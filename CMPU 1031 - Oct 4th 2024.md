### Internal CSS
Used in the head section of a webpage, and is usually used if one single page has a unique style
``` html
<head>
<style>
	p {
	color: red;
	}
</style>
</head>

<body>
	<p>This is RED!</p>
</body>
```

### External CSS
- A dedicated CSS style sheet/file, used to define many styles.
- Using one style sheet can also give a common look and feel, for all webpages.

### ID Selector


## SoC 
- SoC (Separation of Concerns) is a design princple used in computer science. 
- It is the idea that each layer in an application should only be responsible for one task and should not contain code that deals with other tasks.
- In HTML, using SoC, each HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file would have its own file and folder.
- This helps save tie and space, not needed to reqrite rewrite code for each web page
