## Iteration
- Using and executing a piece of code multiple times, iterating on itself. This is often better, as you wouldn't need to write the code multiple times

## While Loops - C
- If the condition is true, it will constantly loop through the statements, unless the condition becomes false.
``` c
while (CONDITION) {
	STATEMENT 1;
	...
	...
	STATEMENT 2;
}
```

### While Block
- The statements in the while loop

## Do While Loops - C
- Completely different to while loops. DO NOT CONFUSE
- In a Do While loop, the Do block will always execute atleast once. If the while block is true, it will execute the while block and go back up to the do.
- It is helpful in menu driven systems, as it lets the user input a value, such as the user's details.
``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	float num = 1;
	float total = 0;
	
	// Asks the user to input a number
	do{
		printf("\nEnter a number (enter 0 to finish): ");
		scanf("%f", &num);
		
		if (num == 0) {
			printf9("\nBye Bye");
			break;
		}
		total = total + num;
	} // END DO
	
	// If the number the user entered is NOT 0, ie. it ends
	// Then it prints out the final total
	while (num != 0) {
		printf("\nThe final total is %.1f", total)
		return 0;
	} // END WHILE
}
```

- Here is another example of a Do While Loop.
- This prints out hi atleast once, then sees if the while statement is true. If it is, it will continue to print out hi, until the condition is false.

``` c
int num = 2;
do {
	num -= 1;
	print("Hi");
	
	if num == 0:
		breakv;
}
while (num != 0) ;
```
