### Questions
- Would doctors earn the same amount as peasants?
	In a pure communist society, then yes. However, communism isn't about money. The reason why communism was made, was because that the bourgosie did few to no work for the amount of money they were getting. Tsar Nicholas was one of the richest man in the world, yet all he did was attend meetings and fuck around. He was rich, because he owned all the land in Russia, and was able to make the workers pay him for the land. Communism aim's to solve this work inequality, and only rewards those who put it in the effort to work.
