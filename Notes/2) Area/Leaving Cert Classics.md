### The Aeneid - Themes

### The Aeneid - Propoganda
- Was commisioned by Augustus for Virigl to write a national epic as part of Augustus's propoganda program.
- It was done to celebrate the new golden age of peace that Augustus's reign ushered in.

- Aeneas is pious and virtuous, and can be seen as a model Roman.
- He is God-fearing, but respectful of Roman religious traditions. This can be seen when he prays to the God Apollo to seek help to find a homeland for his people, the Romans. Apollo instructs Aeneas to go to the land of his ancestors.

- Propoganda can also be seen on the shield of Aeneas.
- Aeneas' shield was brought to him by his mother Venus, who asked the talented blacksmish Vulcan to craft.
- On this shield, there was many depictions of the power and greatness of Rome.
- On the center of the shield, it shows emporer Augustus, leading the Italians into combat.
- Augustus is seen with many Gods supporting and backing him up. This shows that Augustus was favoured by the Gods, and had their help on his side.
- The placement of this on the center of the shield reiterates that Augustus's victory was central to the founding of the new Roman imperial age.

- Throughout the Aeneid, Virgil also reminds the reader many times that Caesar and Augustus descened from the Gods, (Aeneas's mother Venus), and a long line of heroic figures (Aeneas).
- This repetition instilled in the minds of the Roman citizens that Caesar and Augustus was both divine, and heroic.
- It is also prophesized in the Aeneid that in there will be a son of God, called Augustus who will "bring back the golden years" of Rome. Many grandiose language is used to emphasize the divine heritage of Augustus.

- The Golden age refers to Augustus' victory at the battle of Actium.
