### The Odyssey - Key Scenes
**Polyphemus' Island**
- Odysseus and his men spent several days at sea with no land in sight as they were trying to travel home.
-  Finally, they found an island, the land of the cyclops, sons of Poseidon.
- Odysseus picked out 12 of his best men on deck, and planned to meet the island's inhabitants and explore the island.
- Once on the island, Odysseus found a large cave with many sheep inside.
- When he entered the cave, he realised that it was the home of one of the cyclops.
- He found vases with goat's milk and fresh cheese. He tasted the foods, and planned to negotiate with the owner of the cave for spare food.
- When the cyclops returned, Odysseus and his men hid in fear. However, they were found out when the cyclops lit a fire.
- The cyclops was Polyphemus, and Odysseus introduced himself and asked for hospitalty. Polyphemus said that he does not return hospitality to beings inferior to him, grabbing two of Odysseus' men and eating them.
- Polyphemus then blocked the cave with a stone, preventing Odysseus from escaping, and fell asleep.
- Odysseus's men planned to kill Polyphemus when he was sleeping, however Odysseus told them they would be trapped due to the stone.
- The next day, Polyphemus opened the cave to let his sheep out, but prevented Odysseus and his men to leave.
- Odysseus came up with a plan to avenge his men, grabbing and sharpening a wooden spike.
- When Polyphemus returned, Odysseus poured in a jar the wine from the wineskins of all his men, as offering for the cyclops.
- Polyphemus drank the wine, asked for Odysseus' name, whom Odysseus answered as "nobody".
- Polyphemus then was like, super duper ooper eepy. So he like kinda just went to bed and just eeped.
- Odysseus and his men took the wooden spike, and stabbed his eye.
- Polyphemus woke up in agony, screaming in pain. The noise caused his brothers to come check him out, but he answered that "nobody stabbed his eye". So the other cyclops returned home.
- The next day, when morning came, the now blind Polyphemus opened the cave for his sheep to graze, using his hands to feel if it was his sheep that left and not Odysseus.
- Odysseus and his men grappled onto the underbelly of the sheep, and managed to escape.
- When he got to his ship, he shouted and sayed that Polyphemus deserved being blind, as he was a criminal for rejecting criminal. He then cried out his name, saying that it was the King of Ithaca, Odysseus who blinded him.
- When Poseidon heard of this, he prevented Odysseus from returning home, cursing him to wander the sea for years.

**Trojan Horse**
- During the 9th year of the Trojan war, the Greeks came up with a plan to end the war.
- They first crafted a large wooden horse, and hid all the men inside, creating the appearance that they had left the city, and giving a present to the Trojans.
- They then left a Greek called Sinon tied up to a pole, as a sacrifice to the Gods.
- When Sinon was interrogated, Sinon said that the Greeks had offended the Goddess Athena, who was on the Greek's side. As a result, a plague spread across the Greeks.
- Without the support of Athena, the Greeks believed it would be impossible to capture Troy, and used the wooden horse as a source of offering.
- Many of the Trojans believed this story, and was wondering what to do with it.
- They ended up leading the horse to Troy, believing that housing such a grandiose offering would bring up their relations with the Gods.
- The wooden horse was moved to the center of the city of Troy, and they began a celebration of their victory.
- Under the guise of night, when everyone slept, a trap door opened in the wooden horse and the Greek infantry emerged.
- Odysseus, Menalaus, and many more infiltrated the city, killing many. 
- They also sent out a signal at night, as many Greek ships were also stationed secreted by the river banks. This gave Agamemnon, who was the leader of the army there, signal to start advancing towards the city.
- Nearly all of the people in the city of Troy were killed, not even civilians, women, or children were spared.

**Circe**
- When Odysseus arrived at Circe's island, she provided hospitality to Odysseus' men, giving them a large feast.
- Circe however, used a magic potion in their drinks to transform Odysseus' men to pigs.
- Eurylochus, who suspected it to be a trap, did not drink or eat of anything by Circe, and managed to escape to Odysseus.
- Odysseus learned about what happened to the men, and immediately planned to go back and rescue them.
- However, his men begged him to leave, before everyone was turned into pigs.
- Odysseus, feeling a sense of duty, believed that he had to save the rest of his men, even if it costed his life.
- As he set off alone, he met Hermes who gave him an antidote to Circe's potion.
- As Odysseus went to Circe, she offered him a drink with the magic potion.
- However, she was surprised and was was in fear when Odysseus did not turn.
- Odysseus threatened Circe with his sword, which Circe replyed that she will sleep with him if he spared his life.
- Odysseus accepted the invitation, on the oath that his men will be spared and freed.
- Circe returned the pigs back into his men, and they celebrated with a feast.
- Odysseus stayed on Circe's island for a year, before being confronted by his men to return home.
- Circe allowed this, on the offer that he will have to go to the underworld in search of answers. 

### The Odyssey - Role of Athena
- Primary supporter for Odysseus, both directly and indirectly.
- They were alike, as they were skillful schemers.
- Athena's relationship to Odysseus can be seen as an act of mentoship, protection, and divine favor.
 
- Athena is seen asking Zeus to release Odysseus from Calpypso, arguing that he has spent over seven years as a captive.
- Athena also disguises Odysseus as a begger during his return to Ithaca, allowing him to enter his palace without being recognised.
- Athene advises Peneloper to offther the suitors the bow and arrow contest. This was done to palce the weapon into Odysseus' hands.
- When the battle in the great hall breaks out, Athena is personally there giving out advice and encouragement for Odysseus. This was important as Odysseus feared he was losing control of the situation.
- Athena also pleads with her father Zeus to end the fighting between Odysseus andthe suitor's relatives. Zeus responds by sending a lightning bolt to stop the fighting.

### The Aeneid - Themes

### The Aeneid - Propoganda
- Was commisioned by Augustus for Virigl to write a national epic as part of Augustus's propoganda program.
- It was done to celebrate the new golden age of peace that Augustus's reign ushered in.

- Aeneas is pious and virtuous, and can be seen as a model Roman.
- He is God-fearing, but respectful of Roman religious traditions. This can be seen when he prays to the God Apollo to seek help to find a homeland for his people, the Romans. Apollo instructs Aeneas to go to the land of his ancestors.

- Propoganda can also be seen on the shield of Aeneas.
- Aeneas' shield was brought to him by his mother Venus, who asked the talented blacksmish Vulcan to craft.
- On this shield, there was many depictions of the power and greatness of Rome.
- On the center of the shield, it shows emporer Augustus, leading the Italians into combat.
- Augustus is seen with many Gods supporting and backing him up. This shows that Augustus was favoured by the Gods, and had their help on his side.
- The placement of this on the center of the shield reiterates that Augustus's victory was central to the founding of the new Roman imperial age.

- Throughout the Aeneid, Virgil also reminds the reader many times that Caesar and Augustus descened from the Gods, (Aeneas's mother Venus), and a long line of heroic figures (Aeneas).
- This repetition instilled in the minds of the Roman citizens that Caesar and Augustus was both divine, and heroic.
- It is also prophesized in the Aeneid that in there will be a son of God, called Augustus who will "bring back the golden years" of Rome. Many grandiose language is used to emphasize the divine heritage of Augustus.

- The Golden age refers to Augustus' victory at the battle of Actium.

- [[#Caesar as a Leader and Person]]

### Battle of Granicus
![|330](https://i.imgur.com/6NphzPX.png)
- Alexander vs Memnon of Rhodes

- Memnon adviesed that they should not risk a battle, and to destroy all crops and grass, even gutting the towns to leave no resources to Alexander's army.

- Alexander's army was massed into 2 groups of phalanx's. and was protected by 2 groups of cavalry on the left and right flank of them.
- Philotas and Alexander controlled the right cavalry flank, whilst Parmenio controlled the left cavalry flank.

- There was a river separating them, and the Persians were on higher land.
- It was also a very broad front.
- Parmeniop advised to wait until day time, so that they can cross the river when the Persian army retreated.

- However, Alexander believed that the water was only a "mere trickle", and that the same army has crossed worse terrains without difficulty.
- He also believed that if they hesitated now, it would give the Persian army courage out of their hesitation. The Greeks were not cowards, and will not back down.

- Parmenia and philotas entered first, with the infantry following behind.
- The fight was intense, as the Persian army aimed downwards with projectiles to push the Greek army back.
- However, Alexander's army pushed back with an even greater force.
- Alexander saw Darius' brother in law, and engaged with hand-to-hand combat with him. Alexander won, however he was nearly struck from behind by a Persian general, saved only by Cleitus.
- When the cavalry reached the centre of the persian army, their army collapsed, breaking it into 2 separate parts.
- Alexander had won the battle.
- After, Alexander burred the Greeks whom were killed with their armor, and gave tax relief to their wives and children, as a sort of respect.

### Battle of Issus
![|330](https://i.imgur.com/cpEyWwn.png)

### Battle of Gaugamela
![|330](https://i.imgur.com/uu3P1U5.png)
- Alexander's army was inferior in numbers when compared to Darius' army.
- Alexander set up a meeting with the officers, to plan on what to do.
- Many officials suggested an immediate advance, however Alexander took Parmenio's advice to scout out the area first and examine the ground he was fighting on.
- After, Alexander called another meeting with all his solders, rallying them and preparing them for combat the next day.

- However, that night Parmenio went to Alexander's tent after this meeting, urging him to attaack under the cover of night.
- Alexander refused this, as he knew that he was not gonna "steal victory like a thief". Also, it was very risky, as it needed to be carefully planned as otherwise it would end up in confusion. Alexander did not have to time to give each of the troops these orders. The third reason was that even if victory was won at nighttime, Darius would not have to admit to inferiority, due to being attacked at a vulnerable time.

- During the battle the next day, the two armies lined up against each other.
- Darius took lead at the center of his army, surrounded by infantry and scythed chariots to the front, and many cavalry units at his sides.
- Alexander on the other hand, took a risky approach. He ordered his army to take more of a slanted curved shape, with the right cavalry units placed closer to Darius' army.

- When the battle started, Alexander immediatly pushed forward on his right cavalry flank towards Darius, who replied by doing the same. Alexander wanted to reach the ground which was more rough, as he knew that Darius' chariots would not do well in unleveled land.
- Meanwhile, Parmenio did the same on the left cavalry flank, although not as aggressive.
- In Darius's perspective, it would seem that Alexander is leaving his central Phalanx's and Infantry open. So in response, he sent his scythed chariots forwards to take advantage.
- Unbeknownst to Darius, the night before, Alexander warned his troops how to defend against these chariots, due to the intel gathered from scouting the area. The infantry, following Alexander's advice, expertly manouvred themselves into verticle lines.
- When the scythed chariots pushed forward against Alexander's infantry, the horses would run straight through the gaps created. Thus, giving the phalanx time to aim their spears and attack the chariots.
- As Alexander fought on the right cavalry flank, he spotted an opening to Darius, which was created by the absence of the chariots. Thus, Alexander pushed forward towards Darius, breaking through and outflanking the Persians.
- Alexander's push from the right cavalry flank to the center of the Persian army worked, as Darius' army slowly disintegrated and lost their positioning. However, he was unable to give further chase to Darius, as Parmenio on the left cavalry flank was struggling.
- Alexander, isntead of chasing after Darius, decided to go back over to Parmenio's section to help out.
- Alexander's men were recovered, and Darius retreated.

### Battle of Hydaspes
- Alexander vs King Porus
- As Alexander crossed the Indus River, he spotted Porus' main army by a river.
- Alexander ordered his troops to dismantle the floatillas used to cross the Indus river, and to recontruct them for use in the crossing of this river.
- Meanwhile, Porus was preparing his troops as he could see Alexander.
- Porus stationed many elephants at the river banks, and behind them, many many troups.
- Porus has a massive army, and it would be certain death to Alexander if he decided to cross.
- This was because the elephants would scare away Alexander's cavalry units, but also, his army would slowly be picked off due to the amount of ranged units Porus had stationed there.

- Alexander used psychological warfare against Porus, calling many of the men to go up and down the river screaming, as if they were going to cross. This caused Porus to become complacent, as he was unable to predict which one was a rouse.
- Meanwhile, Alexander was scouting out potential places his army could cross safely.
- Around 30 kilometers up from the river, Alexander noticed a bend in the river with a small island between the two sides. This island was heavilly wooded with trees, and would be perfect for a crossing.
- Alexander then spaced his army out parallel to the river, so that communication could be done through using sounds and fire.

- Alexander calls Craterus to stay on the riverbank opposite to Porus's main army, and to not cross but wait for him until he commands half of the troops the island he spotted.
- When Alexander reached the river bend, he assembled his flotilla of boats, and crossed over sneakily.
- When Alexander crossed to the island, Porus' son spotted him, although he as too late. Alexander then proceeded to cross to the other side.
- Porus sent his son and some of his troops to stop Alexander, however they were swiftly defeated by Alexander.
- Porus then started to shift his army towards Alexander, as he was now on the same side as him.
- Porus spaced out 100 elephants at the center of his army towards Alexander, knowing that his cavalry units would be unable to break through, as they would startle the horses. Although Alexander was outnumbered, the discipline and training the Greek infant recieved, would quickly show the power of his army.
- Alexander first sent his long ranged units, and his phalanx units to take up space and attack the elephants. Meanwhile, Alexander's right cavalry flank fought Porus' left flank. Porus saw that his left flank was collapsing, and sent the cavalry from his right to back them up.
- However, this was a mistake. This was because he opened up his right side, which the cavalry units from Alexander's left side quickly siezed. They managed to use the opportunity to get behind Porus, and sandwhich Porus' left cavalry units.
- This caused many of Porus' elephants to panic, trampling their own soldiers.
- Although Porus was losing, he refused to give up.
- When he was defeated, Alexander asked how he wished to be treated. Porus replied that he wished to be treated like how a king treats another king. Alexander was impressed, and appointed him as the new satrap of Punjab.

### Alexander as a Leader and Person

### Caesar as a Leader and Person
- He was very cruel and inhumane to the treatment of the Gauls.
- He claimed and boasted he killed over 1 million Gauls, and captured and sold another 1 million.
- He also ransacked and destroyed over 800 towns.
- Although these figures may be exaggerated, Caesar still used this figures as prop;oganda to show the powr and brutality of the Roman empire.

- Although he slaughtered and conquored many of the barbarians, he also allowed him men to do everything. This would included pillaged the villages, rape, and capture the Gauls.
- The Gauls were called Barbarians, and treated as outsiders inferior to the Romans.

- His treatment can also be seen in the capture of helvetian, where out of the 350,00 people, less then 100,000 people survived.
- Meanwhile at Vetti, Caesar exterminated almost their entire fleet, forcing them to surrender. The civilians were then all sold into slavery.
