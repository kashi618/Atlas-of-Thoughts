- As long as S.B maintains his financial authority, there is a power dynamic between him, Gar, and Madge.

**Power Dynamic Between S.B and Gar (FInancial)

- Treated like a child by S.B, *"Im 25, yet you treat me as if I were 5"
- Wishing for his father to show some emotion towards his departure, for him to make *"one unpredictable remark"*
- Kate left Gar due to two things. First, he wouldn't stand up for himself, and ask to take her hand in marrige. Second, he did not have financial stability, like his father. So he becomes powerless, as Kate finds a new man, Francis king, whom is wealthy.

**By Frank Darabont**

**Humanity**
- Andy gives Red a harmonica, a symbol of hope

- There is a sense of humanity, and friendship.

**Gender**
- Only a handful of women shown throughout the prison. Andy's wife who had an affair, and the posters of Rita Hayworth and Raquel Welchn whom are objectified.
- The women are also very sexualised and sterotypical, there only as objects of obsession. Evident in the movie scene and the posters.
- Macho culture is very prominent, and power is held through violent means. Beatings given to prisoners who don't obey.
- Men whom are seen as *"weak and frail"* such as the *"fatty"*, are taunted, and given beatings.

**Social Class**
- Work and money is very important for Warden Norton.
- *"Inside out"* program used as a front for Warden Norton to gain money, whilst forcing the prisoners to work hard labour. This is hidden behind the excuse of letting them *"join back with society"*.
