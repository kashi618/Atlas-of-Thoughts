### Program Counter
* A special register which keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction to be executed in a program
### Protocol
- A set of rules and procedures used to govern how computers send and recieve data in a network
- #### Types:
	HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, IP, VOIP
	- **HTTP** - A protocol used for fetching HTML websites and documents.
	- **HTTPS** - A protocol used for fetching HTML websites and documents, but with an added security layer of encyption and decryption.
	- **IP** - The protocol used for routing packets from a source using a network of connected computers
	- **VOIP** - The protocol for transmitting voice/audio over IP.


### Important of ASCI standards
- Can ensure universal communication, allowing computers from one side of the world communicate effectively with another side of the world.
- Provides backwards and forwards compatibility.
- Provides a way for data to be encoded in a standard way
### Limitation of ASCI
- Limited amount of characters available, only supporting a number of 2^7 characters.
- Does not allow for emojis
- Does not have enough unique characters for every language

### Heuristics
- Used to find a best approximate solution, for when finiding the exact solution may take too long.

### Time Complexity/Big O Notation
### Importance of the Study of Algorithmic Efficiency
- Allows for the best and fastest algorithm to be used for a specific problem
- Allows for algorithms which uses the least amount of computing power and memory.
- Helps understand the reasons why some algorithms may be slower, uses more memory, uses more computing power, etc. This can then help developers make better algorithms.

### Importance of Turing Machines
- Can be used to compute and calculate any problems which can be calculated.

### Artificial Intelligence Ethics
**Positives**
- Can be used for healthcare, such as identifying cancer.
- Can be used for weather, such as predicting the weather or natural disasters.
- Can be used to lessen vehicle crashes, as automated vehicles can't be subjected to drunk driving, impared driving, etc.
- Can be used 24/7.
**Negatives**
- Can have ethical issues, as it has no regard for emotions. This can be abused in warfare, with automated weaponry.
- Data privacy, as training AI engines require large databases.
- Can be biased due to the databases it uses
- Over reliance in AI can result in decreased human skills and critical thinking skills.
