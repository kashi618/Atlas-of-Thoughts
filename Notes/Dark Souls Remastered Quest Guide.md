<h2><center> AFTER ACQUIRING LORDVESSEL </h2></center>

---

DISCLAIMER: If you wish to do the Darkwraith Covenant for Red Eye Orbs, or simply to get the Age of Darkness Ending, do NOT place the Lordvessel for Fraampt in FireLink Shrine.

If you want the Covenant but not the ending, I’ll address how to do that BELOW.

**Darkwraith Covenant/Kaathe the Primordial Serpant Ending (Darkroot Garden)**
- Past the Forest Hunters, head for the giant door and defeat Sif for the Ring he holds.

**Darkwraith Covenant/Kaathe the Primordial Serpant Ending (New Londo Ruins)**
- Head through the area and in the first building past the first fog gate climb the ladder inside to the roof. Accept the key from Ingward and then continue to unflood New Londo.
- Head for the Four Kings, kill them and Kaathe will appear to talk to you.
- He takes you to where the Lordvessel must be placed. You can join his covenant.
*(IF YOU WANT THE AGE OF DARKNESS ENDING, PLACE THE LORDVESSEL NOW. OTHERWISE, YOU CAN HOMEWARD BONE OR HOMEWARD MIRACLE OUT.)*


**Dusk of Oolacile A.K.A Beginning the DLC (Darkroot Garden via Tower in Undead Burg entrance)**
- In the area full of Blue Crystal enemies, head to the water and kill the Hydra (Firebombs help alot.)
- Once killed, quit and reload the game then keep rolling through the water (beware of going too far right cause it becomes too deep) and a golden crystal will be at the dead-end. Kill it to free Dusk of Oolacile.
- Say YES to her dialogue, then when she disappears head back to the Blue Crystals where the Hydra was. Her summon symbol will be near a rock on the waters shore.
- Summon Dusk, buy everything (optional?)
