Principle reason

"Althought it is absolutely true that we must believe that there is a God, because we are so thought in the Holy Scriptures, and, on the other hand that we must beliveve the Holy Scriputes because they come from God"

"For the importance of the subject, and the glory of God to which all this relates, contrain me to speak here somewhat more freely of myself than is my habit. Nevertheless, whatever certainty and evidence I find in my reasons, I cannot persuade myself that all the world is capable of understanding them."

## Understanding The Principles
" I apprehend that they cannot be adequately understood by many, both because they are also a little lengthy, and dependent the one on the other, and principally because they demanad a mind wholly free of prejudices, and one which can be easily detached from the affairs fo the senses"

"And, truth to say, there are not so many in the world who are fitted for metaphysical speculations as there are for those of geometry."
