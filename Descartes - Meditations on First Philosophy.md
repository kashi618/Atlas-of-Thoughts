**Perspicacity** - The ability to notice, realize, gain clairty, and understand things quickly, especially when it is difficult or nuanced
**Perspicuity** - The ability to express, think, write, things clearly and understandable for a large number of people

## Existence of God
### Descartes' View
- The existence that the human soul does not perish with the body
- God Exists

"Although it is absolutely true that we must believe that there is a God, because we are so thought in the Holy Scriptures, and, on the other hand that we must beliveve the Holy Scriputes because they come from God"

*But this is a circle argument, and does not convince non believers.*

### Reasoning behind people who don't believe in God
- The human soul is distinct from the human body
- God does not exist

"I am aware that the pincipal reason which causes many impious persons not to desire to believe that there is a God, and that the human soul is distinct from the body, is that they devlare that hitherto no one has been able to demonstrate these two facts"

### Other
"For the importance of the subject, and the glory of God to which all this relates, contrain me to speak here somewhat more freely of myself than is my habit. Nevertheless, whatever certainty and evidence I find in my reasons, I cannot persuade myself that all the world is capable of understanding them."

## Understanding The Principles
To understand, you need to be unbiased and open.

" I apprehend that they cannot be adequately understood by many, both because they are also a little lengthy, and dependent the one on the other, and principally because they demanad a mind wholly free of prejudices, and one which can be easily detached from the affairs fo the senses"

"And, truth to say, there are not so many in the world who are fitted for metaphysical speculations as there are for those of geometry."

## Objections
"The first objection is that it does not follow from the fact that the human mind reflecting on itself does not percieve itself ot be other than thing that htinks, that its nature or its essence consists only in its beig a thing that thinks, in the sense that this world ony excludes all other things whih might also be supposed to pertain to the nature of the soul."

"The second objection is that it does not afollow from the fact that I have myself the idea of somthing more perfect than I am, that this idea is more perfect than I, and much less that what is represented by this idea exists."
"From the sole fact that I have in qmyself the idea of a thing more perfect than myself, it follows that this thing truly exists"

"I shall only say in general that all taht is said by the atheist against the existence of God, always depends either on the fact that we ascribe to God affection which are human, or that we attrivute so much strength and wisdom to our minds that we even have the presumption to desire to determine and understand that which God can an ought to do."
