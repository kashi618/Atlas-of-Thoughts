## Question 1
### (a)
**Entity**: A thing or object that represents a real world object. In this case, the entities are the tables `friendship`, `post`, `users`, and `likes`.

**Attribute**: A property/characteristic of of an entity. In this case, the fields `userid1`, `userid2`, `friendsince` are attributes of the entity `friendship`

**Relationship**: A relationship is how one table links to another table. For example, the table posts has a `1:N` (`one to many) relationship with the table `users`

**Primary Key**: A unique attribute in a table. This means that there are no duplicates, cannot be NULL, and that each value is different. It is used to identify a row in a table

**Foreign Key**: An attribute in a table that corresponds with the value of a primary key from another table

### (b)
```sql
SELECT title, username 
FROM post JOIN users USING (userid)
WHERE postdate < '2023-01-01'; 
```

### (c)
```sql
SELECT concat(firstname, ' ', lastname)
FROM users LEFT JOIN post USING (userid)
WHERE postid IS NULL;
```

### (d)
```sql
SELECT title, AVG(likescount) as AverageLikes
FROM post
GROUP BY title;
```

### (e)
```
ALTER TABLE post ADD COLUMN Shares INTEGER;
```
