Relational databases use ERD models to represent databases considering:
- The entities involved (things about which data is stored)
- Relationships/associations among those entities
- Attributes/properties of both the entities and their relationships

## Types of Entities
**Strong entities**
- Exist independently of another

**Weak entities**
- Depends on another entity
