"A programming paradigm is a way or style of writing code. It's a set of rules and concepts that guide how programs are structured and executed"

## Basis of Programming Languages
- Input
- Output
- Statements
- Decision
- Repeat

##  Imperative and Procedural
### Imperative
- Code executed step by step in a sequential manner
- Focuses on HOW tasks are performed

**Example**
Bash scripts

### Procedural
- A subset of imperative, but uses functions to organize and reuse logic

**Disadvantages**
- Issues with scaling
- More functions = more complexity/harder to track dependencies

**Example**
- C

## Object-Oriented (OOP)
Based on representing a program as a set of objects and the interactions between them
- Code organized around objects and classes, with attributes and methods
- Encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism
- Models real-world entities and their interactions

**Examples**
- Python, Kotlin, R, Java Streams, Lisp

## Functional (FP)
- Focuses on pure functions and immutable data

**Example**
- Python, Kotlin, R, Java Streams, Lisp

## Declarative
Focuses on WHAT to do, not HOW to do it

**Example**
- HTML, SQL

## Hybird (Mix of Paradigms)
Languages that support multiple paradigms

**Example**
- Python, Java, Kotlin
