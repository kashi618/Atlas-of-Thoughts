"A programming paradigm is a way or style of writing code. It's a set of rules and concepts that guide how programs are structured and executed"

## Basis of Programming Languages
- Input
- Output
- Statements
- Decision
- Repeat

## Types of Programming Paradigms
###  Imperative and Procedural
#### Imperative
- Code executed step by step in a sequential manner
- Focuses on HOW tasks are performed

**Example**
Bash scripts

#### Procedural
- A subset of imperative, but uses functions/procedures to organize and reuse logic. 

**Advantages**
- Step by step execution is easy to understand
- Efficient for small projects, as no complex structures are needed. (no need for objects, classes, etc)
- Easier debugging. Linear execution allows modular testing, allowing you to test code block by block.


**Disadvantages**
- Issues with scaling
- More functions = more complexity/harder to track dependencies
- Code duplication is common for similar functions

**Example**
- C, pascal

### Object-Oriented (OOP)
Based on representing a program as a set of objects and the interactions between them.
- Code organized around objects and classes, with attributes and methods
- Encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism
- Models real-world entities and their interactions

**Examples**
- Kotlin, R, Java Streams, Lisp

### Functional (FP)
- Focuses on pure functions and immutable data

**Example**
- Python, Kotlin, R, Java Streams, Lisp

### Declarative
Focuses on WHAT to do, not HOW to do it

**Example**
- HTML, SQL

### Hybird (Mix of Paradigms)
Languages that support multiple paradigms

**Example**
- Python, Java, Kotlin
