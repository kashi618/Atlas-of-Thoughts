## JVM - Java Virtual Machine
This is the foundation of java. It is a runtime environment used for executing Java bytecode.

## JRE - Java Runtime Environment
This is the base Java package that contains all the libraries the Java programs use. It also includes the JVM.

It is essentially `JRE = JVM + Libraries & files req to run java Programs`

## JDK - Java Development Kit
The JDK is a superset of the JRE. It is a full fledged development suite. It contains everything the `JVM + JRE`, but also included these following tools:
- **javac**: the java compiler
- **jar**: java packaging tool
- **javadoc**: java documentation generator
- Debugger, and other develpoment tools

## Conclusion
For end users (people needing to run java programs) the JRE is all you need

For developers (people writing java code) the JDK is all you need
