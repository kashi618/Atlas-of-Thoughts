Methods are essentially functions, just a different term used in OOP. As such, they allow you to reuse blocks of code.

## Syntax for Method
```java showlinenumbers
accessModifier returnType methodName(datatype parameterName) {
	// code here
}
```

**Example**
```java showlinenumbers
public void hello(int age) {
	System.out.println("Hello! You are "+age);
}
```
