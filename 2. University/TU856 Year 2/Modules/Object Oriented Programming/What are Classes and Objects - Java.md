## Classes
- A Class is s blueprint which individual objects are created 
- Every class has its *methods* and *attributes* that can be accessed and manipulated through the objects

- A class is just a template, that allows you to instantiate (create) objects
- To use a class, we can create an object. Each object contains a state, and a behaviour.
