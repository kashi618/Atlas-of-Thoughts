## What is a Class?
- A Class is s blueprint which individual objects are created 
- Every class has its *methods* and *attributes* that can be accessed and manipulated through the objects

- A class is just a template, that allows you to instantiate (create) objects

### Example
A book can be a class, and contain objects such as a book title, author, and price.
Another example of a class could be a student. The student objects could be their name, ID, and email.
