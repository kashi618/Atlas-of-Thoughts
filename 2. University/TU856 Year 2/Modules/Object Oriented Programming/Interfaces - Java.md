## What is it?
A description of a set of behaviours/actions
A class that implements an interface must implement the actions/methods declared in the interface.
This can be helpful for forcing certain methods for security purposes. (such as closing a file after using it)

**Exampke**
```java showlinenumbers
Interface MammalBehavious {
	// Actions/methods
	void breathe();
	void speak();
}
```


##

Interfaces cannot have instance attributes. It has to be static
