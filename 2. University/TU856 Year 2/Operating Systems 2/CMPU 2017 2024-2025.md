### a)
The four conditions required for Deadlock to occur is,
- Mutual exclusion
- Hold and wait
- Circular wait
- Non Preemptive

### b)
To push a node onto a stack, you will need to first:
Allocate and create a new stack node inside of heap memory, and assign it a value
Then, set the new node (nextPtr) to point to the topPtr node.
After, you set topPtr to the new node.

### c)
Lets say we have a ordered linked list with 3 nodes as such, and we want to add a node with the value 3.

We first create and allocate a ListNode inside of heap memory using malloc, and then check if done successfully
`ListNode* newPtr = malloc(sizeof(ListNode));`
`if (newPtr != NULL) {}`

The value 3 is then assigned to the new node, and a default NULL is assigned as its nextPtr
`newPtr->data = 3; newPtr->nextPtr = NULL;`

Now we create temporary nodes currentPtr and previousPtr
We assign currentPtr to sPtr (the pointer of the address location of the first node in the list), and previousPtr to NULL

We now run a loop that constantly checks if the node value of currentPtr is greater than the value 3. If it is not, it moves previousPtr to currentPtr, and currentPtr to nextPtr. When it finds the spot for the new node, the previousPtr is set to point to the address of the new node. The new node is then set to point at the address of the currentPtr.

If the loop exits out immediately, that means the new node is to be inserted at the beginning. In this case, the new node is set to point at the sPtr, then the sPtr is set to point at the new node.

Lets say we add 2 new nodes to an empty stack. (3 and 7)
