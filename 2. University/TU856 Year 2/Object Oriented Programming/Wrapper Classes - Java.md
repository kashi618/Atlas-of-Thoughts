They are the Java class version of the 8primitive data types

| Primitive Data Type | Wrapper Class |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| `byte`              | Byte          |
| `short`             | Short         |
| `int`               | Integer       |
| `long`              | Long          |
| `float`             | Float         |
| `double`            | Double        |
| `boolean`           | Boolean       |
| `char`              | Character     |
- However, primitive types are fast and easy to use

## Why?
Due to them being classes, each wrapper has its own methods, giving greater functionality

Due to them being classes, they can also be used in [[Arrays and ArrayLists - Java]]

## Notes
- Remember that they are a class. This means, they store a reference (address) in memory of the object
- Compared to primitive data types, which directly store the values
