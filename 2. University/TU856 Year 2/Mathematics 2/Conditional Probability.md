The probability of an even B occurring, given that an event A occurred.
$P(A|B)$, the probability of B given A

It can be found using the formula:
$P(B|A)=\frac{P(B∩A)}{P(A)}$

**Example**
In a class,
- 25% failed maths
- 15% failed chemistry
- 10% failed both

1. What percentage failed chemistry, given that they also failed maths?

$M:failed\ maths$ $C:failed\ chemistry$
$P(M)=0.25$ $P(C)=0.15$ $P(M∩C)=0.10$

$P(C|M)=\frac{P(C∩M)}{P(M)}$

$\frac{P(C∩M)}{P(M)}=\frac{0.10}{0.25}=\frac{2}{5}=40\%$
