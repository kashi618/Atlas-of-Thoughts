A random probability experiment in which there are only two possible outcomes.
They are often denoted $P$ (success/0) and $Q$ (failure/1).
Each trial are independent, meaning the success or failure of one trial, does not influence/affect the outcome of any other trial.

**Examples of a Bernoulli Trials**
- Flipping a coin once. (heads, tails)

## Formula
$P(X=r)=\ ^{n}C_{r}\ *p^{r}*q^{n-r}$
- R = the desired number of successes
- n = the number of trials
- p = probability of success
- q = probability of failure

**Example Question**
A photocopier breaks 17 days out of 100.
