## Differences?
**Combination**: order is **NOT** important
- Pizza toppings, menu items, etc
**Permutation**: order **IS** important
- Passwords, seating arrangements

## Combinations
It is an arrangement of items where order doesn't matter. For example, `AB` is the same as `BA`, as order doesn't matter.

**Question: How many ways can you arrange 2 out of 3 letters (a,b,c)**
`S = {AB, AC, BC}`
- There are 3 possible combinations

### Combination Formula
Can also be know as `n choose r`
$^{n}C_{r}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

## Permutations
It is an arrangement of items in a specific order. For example, `ABC` is considered different from `CBA`, due to order.

**Question: How many ways can you arrange 2 out of 3 letters (a,b,c)**
`S = {AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB}`
There are 6 possible permutations

### Permutation Formula
$^{n}P_{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-1)}$
