For two sets $A$ and $B$:
- $(A∪B)^{c}=A^{c}∩B^{c}$
- $(A∩B)^{c}=A^{c}∪B^{c}$
Basically changes between a union and intersection

**Example**
A card drawn at random from 52 deck, what is probability it is neither a 4 OR a club
$F:$ card is 4 -> $F^{c}:$ card is NOT 4
$C:$ card is a club -> $C^{c}:$ card is NOT a club

$F^{c}∩C^{c}:$ neither a 4 or club

So to find this, we can convert it into something more manageable
$F^{c}∩C^{c}=(F∪C)^{c}$

$P(4)=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}$
$P(club)=\frac{12}{52}=\frac{3}{13}$
$P_{4}$
