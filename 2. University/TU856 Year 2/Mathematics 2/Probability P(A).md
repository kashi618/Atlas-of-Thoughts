If `A` is any event that can occur, `P(A)` is the probability of that event occurring
To calculate `P(A)`, it is simply $P(A)=\frac{\#A}{\#S}$


**Example**
Here is the sample space of rolling a dice
`S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}`

$P(1)=\frac{1}{6}=1.6666\%$
$P(1\ or\ 2)=\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}=0.3333\%$

**Special Case**
$P(not\ 4\ or\ 5)=1-P(4\ or\ 5)=1-\frac{2}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$
- Can also be found by $P(4\ or\ 5)$, and then finding the compliment. $A=1-P(4\ or\ 5)$
