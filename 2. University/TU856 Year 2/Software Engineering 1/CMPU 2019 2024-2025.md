## Question 1

## Question 2
### (a)
Modularity is a design principle that breaks down a piece of software into small self contained components called modules. It is important because it allows for encapsulation, high cohesion, and easier maintainability.

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods into a single unit called a class. 

It relates to and increases cohesion, because each class has a single well defined purpose, grouping related data and behaviour together. 

It also relates to and reduces coupling, as it minimises dependencies between classes by restricting access to implementation details, exposing only methods and variables which are needed.

### (b)
Inheritance may increase coupling and decrease cohesion in a parent and child class as it could introduce tight dependencies between them, or introduce and inherit unrelated attributes and methods from the parent class to the child class.

### (c)
An interface is used to define a set of methods that a class must implement, without specifying its implementation.
In the diagram, it shows that Checkout has an interfaced called CardProcessing. This reduces coupliing because Checkout only depends on an abastract CardProcessing interface, not a class. It also increases cohesion because the methods in CardProcessing is separates, into its own well defined purpose.
