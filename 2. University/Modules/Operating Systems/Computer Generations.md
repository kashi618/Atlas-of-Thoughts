**First Generation** (1945-1955)
Vacuum tubes and plugboards
- Contained no operating system
- Programs were entered by manually setting switches
- Very slow and primarily used for scientific calculations

**Second Generation** (1955-1965)
Transistors and batch systems
- Universities started to spend millions on buying computers
- Programs ran on punched cards
- To run a job, the instructions were first punched on cards, resulting in a deck of cards. Then, it is ran through the machine.

**Third Generation** (1965-1980)
Integrated circuits and multiprogramming
- System 360 and S/370 family of computers
- Spooling (simultaneous peripheral operation on-line) (A process where data is temporarily stored in a buffer, before being sent to slower peripheral devices)
- Time sharing (technique that allowed multiple users to share the CPU)
- User programs and data
- Virtual memory
- Multiprogramming (technique that allowed multiple programs to be loaded into memory simultaneously)

**Fourth Generation** (1980-present)
Personal Computers
- LSI (large scale integration) circuits were invented, allowing thousands of transistors on a single chip
- Mass production of affordable computers were available. (Apple II, IBM PC, etc)
- Development and implementation of user-friendly OS which featured GUI's. (MS-DOS, Windows, macOS, etc)
- The performance and portability were greatly improved
- Distributed computing, where multiple independent computers were used together to perform a common task
