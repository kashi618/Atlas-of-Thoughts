There are two main types of interchange (text) files.

**ASCI File**
This type of file stores ASCII characters, with each character occupying 1 byte. For example, `'123'` is stored as `'1', '2', '3'`

**Binary File**
This type of file stores data in raw binary format. For example, `'123'` occupies 2 bytes.
