## What is Utilitarianism?
- An action is good, if it benefits someone
- An action is bad, if it harms someone
  
Morality of an action, has nothing to do with intent.
- It instead focuses on the consequences
- It is a consequentialist theory
  
 **Utility:** tendency of an object to produce happiness, or prevent unhappiness for an individual or community

### Principle of Utility
(Greatest Happiness Principle)
An action is right or wrong, to the extent that it increase or decreases the total happiness of the affected parties.

### Weighing Pleasure and Pain
Intensity: Magnitude of the experience
Duration: How long it lasts
Certainty: Probability of the experience occurring
Propinquity: How close the experience is, in space and time
Fecundity: The ability to produce more of the same experiences
Purity: The extent that pleasure is not diluted by pain
Extend: Number of beings affected

## Act Utilitarianism
Each individual action is evaluated and calculated, directly by its consequences.
1. Identify possible actions in a situation
2. Calculate likely consequences of each action
3. Estimate net happiness, (pleasure minus pain) for all affected
4. Choose action with greatest net utility/happiness

### Case for
- Focuses on happiness
- Down to earth and practical
	- Utilitarian calculus provides a straightforward way to determine the right course of action

### Case against
- Unclear whom to include into calculations
- Complex situations makes too much work to come to each decision
- Ignores our innate sense of duty
- Susceptible to moral luck, where actions do not have the intended consequence

## Rule Utilitarianism
Rule utilitarianism evaluates utility through evaluating rules or principles

**Example:**
If I can write a helpful worm that removes a harmful worm form infected computers, should I do so?

Who would benefit:
- People who don't keep their systems updated

Who would be harmed?
- People who use networks
- People who's computers are invaded by buggy, anti-worms due to bad coding
- System administrators, as they will need to figure out which is good and which is bad

Conclusion:
- Harm outweighs benefits, releasing anti-worm is wrong

### Case for
Compared to act utilitarianism, it is easier to perform utilitarian calculus
- Not every moral decision requires performing utilitarianism calculus

### Case against
- All consequences measured on one scale
	- All units must do the same in order to do the sum
	- In certain circumstances, you will need to quantify the value of a human life. 10 deaths will result from x, but will gain Y to save 100 lives.
