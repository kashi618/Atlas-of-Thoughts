## Core Concept
EU law is a legal system created by the European Union, that operates either alongside, or supersedes the national laws of its member states

**Rules**
- **EU Law takes precedence**: If an Irish law and EU law disagree, EU law wins and must be followed
- **Direct Rights**: Many EU laws give rights directly to people, even if an Irish court has not made its own law about it
- **Automatic Application**: EU regulations become Irish law instantly

## Where it Comes from?
- **Treaties**: the main rulebook all EU countries have signed
- **Laws made by the EU**: 
	- Regulations: Instant automatic laws
	- Directives: Instructions to countries to achieve a result. Irish Law must pass its own laws to comply
	- Decisions: Country, company, or people specific rules

## Who Makes and Enforces it?
European Commission
- Proposes new laws

European Parliament & Council
- Votes to make the laws

Court of Justice of the EU
- "Supreme Court", who makes the final decision about the meaning of the EU law
