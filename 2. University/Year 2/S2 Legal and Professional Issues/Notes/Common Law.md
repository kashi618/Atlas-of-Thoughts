## Core Idera
It is a legal system where the law is shaped by judicial decisions and precedent, instead of written statues or codes. It is often called the "judge made law".

**How it works**
1. **Precedent**: When a judge decides a case, the legal reasoning behind the decision becomes a precedent
2. **Binding Authority**: Lower courts must follow precedents set my higher courts in their jurisdictions
3. **Evolution**: The law develops incrementally, as judges apply old precedents to new similar situation#

## Origin
Originated in England, after the Norman Conquest
- Common law was administered and unified, by royal judges traveling from the [[Curia Regis|curia regis]]
