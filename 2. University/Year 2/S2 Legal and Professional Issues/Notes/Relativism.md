## What is Relativism?
A philosophical position that says there are no universal norms of truth, morality, or right and wrong.
One person can say "X is right", and another can say "X is wrong", but both can be right

## Subjective Relativism
This is the view where morality, and right and wrong is dependent on individual perspectives.
- The truth is in the eye of the beholder
- What's true for you, may not be true for me

**Case Against Subjective Relativism**
Blurs the distinction between doing what you THINK is right, and doing what you WANT to do.
(Hitler and Mother Teresa)

Decisions may not be based on reason
- Right and wrong can be based on tarot cards or dice rolling

**Is it viable?**
Not a workable ethical theory, as it would not persuade others in justification

## Cultural Relativism
This is the view where moral values, and right and wrong, depends on a society's actual moral guidelines
- Practises such as human sacrifices, burial rituals, and dietary restrictions, often differ across societies
- However, are valid within their specific cultural contexts

**Case Against Cultural Relativism**
Many practices such as human sacrifice, is objectively wrong.
Considering the Gaza conflict, both sides believe in their rights for their land. Cultural relativism says that both are entitled to it, which would not work.
