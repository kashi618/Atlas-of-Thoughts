## What is Kantianism?
Philosophical system developed my Immanuel Kant.
It bases morality and ethics on the concept that only universal rules can be rationalised and allowed.

## What is Good?
Kant begins with questioning what is "good", without qualification.
- **Intelligence?**
- **Strength?**
- **Courage?**

He tells us that the only "good" without qualification is good will, even if the end result is not achieved. Reason should cultivate desire to do the right thing, NOT what we want to do.

## Categorical Imperatives
Moral rules can only be appropriate if it follows these two formulas.

### 1st Formulation
Act only from moral rules, that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws.

You should only act, if that action can be applied to everyone.

**Example**
Can a person in dire straits, make a promise with the intention of later breaking it?

First we propose a rule. "I may make promises, with the intention of later breaking them". The person in trouble wants his promise to be believed, so that he can get what he wants.

The proposed universal rule then becomes: "Everyone can make false promises, (even in difficult situations)"

But this rule is flawed, as everyone breaking promises would make promises unbelievable, contradicting the point of believing in promises. Therefore, the action of the troubled person is not moral.

### 2nd Formulation
Act so that you treat both yourself and others as ends in themselves, never as a means to an end

Don't use anyone as a tool, or as a "means to an end"

**Example**
Mary, single mother, works full time.
Takes two evening courses a semester
However, history class requires more work than usual
Mary earns "A" on all work so far
But does not have enough time to write final report
Mary purchases a report, and submits it as her own work

According to the 2nd formulation, this would NOT be morally right. She attempted to deceive the lecturer, treating them as a means to an end.

## Case for Kantianism
Rational and intuitively agreeable and fair
- Gives a reason "why" for a given rule
Produces universal moral guidelines, and treats all persons as moral equals


## Case against Kantianism
- Sometimes no rule adequately characterises an action
	- Stealing to provide for a starving family would NOT be morally right in Kantianism. In Kantianism, stealing is not right whatever the situation
- If we allow for multiple rules to characerise an actoin, there will be no way to resolve a conflict between these rules
