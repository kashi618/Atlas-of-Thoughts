## The Kings Council
"Curia Regis" is latin for "King's Court". It was a medieval royal council in Norman England.
- It was a flexible assembly of the king's tenants-in-chief, bishops, and advisors, that handled all royal businesses such as governance, finance, and disputes.

## Features
1. **Centralization**: By sending royal judges from Curia Regis on circuits to each part of a country, the king's law would slowly become common
2. **Standardization**: These judges would discuss cases, and upon return, would gradually form a uniform body of judge-made rules
3. **Precedent**: Decisions made by these royal judges would operate under the Curia Regis, and was record to be followed in similar future cases
