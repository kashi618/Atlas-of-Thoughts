## Question 1
 **Multi-Tier Application Architecture**
It is a client-server architecture, where different software components are organized into 3 main tiers.
The first layer is the presentation layer.

This is the front end of the application, which contains the user interface. It displays information gathered from the lower tiers.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The second level is the logic layer.
This is the back end of the application. This processes logical decisions, performs calculators, and moves data between a database to the font end
- PHP, Node.js, python, Java

The third level is the data layer.
This is where the database management system is stored and retrieved
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
  
This can be seen in the library project CA.

**Web Life Cycle**
Stage 1 - Define Mission and User Population
- Defines what the mission of the website is
- Finds the target demographic of the website

Stage 2 - Collect User Requirements
- This stage identifies what a user needs, and the constraints
- What browser types

Stage 3 - Conceptual Design
- This stage focuses on how the website will look and feel
  
Stage 4 - Physical Design and Development
- The website is then developed, the plan is translated into code
  
Stage 5 - Usability Testing
- The website is the tested with real people, to ensure that all the goals are met, and that is is easy to navigate

Stage 6 - Implementation and Marketing
- The website is launched, and a domain name is setup and hosted
- The website is also advertised

Stage 7 - Evaluation and Improvement
- Website is improved further using the feedback from users
- Bugs and security issues that come up during usage are also fixed

**URL vs Hostname**
A hostname is a name assigned to host the website you want to access. It is a sub component of the URL. For example, the host name for youtube is "www.youtube.com"

A URL is the complete web address of a website. For example, the URL for a video on youtube is "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F123"

### b)
**Web server criteria**
- Ease of use
- Price
- Security
- Support
- Functionality
- Operating System
<br>
- Nginx
- Apache
- Microsoft Internet Information Services (ISS)

### c)
```php
<?php 
	function multi($num) 
	{ 
		if ($num == 3) echo "I Wonder"; 
		if ($num == 7) echo "Which One"; 
		if ($num == 8) echo "Is The"; 
		if ($num == 19) echo "Correct Answer"; 
	} 
	
	$can = stripos("I love php, I love php too!","PHP");
	multi($can); 
?>
```

Output: "Which One"

### d)
```php
<?php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "AerAirways");
if ($conn->connect_error) {
	die("Connection failed: ".$conn->connect_error);
}

$origin = $_GET['going_from'];

$sql = "SELECT Airport.country, Flight.flightNum
		FROM Flight JOIN Airport
		ON Flight.goingTo = Airport.airport
		WHERE Flight.GOingFrom = '$origin'
		ORDER BY Airport.country";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

$lastCountry = ""; 
echo "<ul>"; 
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
	if ($row['country'] != $lastCountry) {
		$lastCountry = $row['$lastCountry'];
		echo "<li>" . $ row['country'] . "</li>";
	}
	echo "<ul><li>" . $row['flightNum'] . "</li></ul>"; }
} 
echo "</ul>";

mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

## Question 2
### a)
XML
- XML is a markup language, using tags similar to HTML
- Data is placed between an open and close tag. "\<tag>\</tag>"
- There are no datatypes, everything is stored as a string

JSON
- JSON is a data interchange format, which uses key-value pairs and arrays
- It has support for various datatypes such as strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays
- Easier to read and understand than XML

### b)
How to define a function?
"function functionName(parameters) (function body)" 

### c)
```php
echo "\$x";
```

### d)
```json
{
	"serviceBill": {
		"customer": "Steven Murphy",
		"services": [
			{
				"date": "20,05,2024",
				"service": "Kitchen Flooring"
				"id": 122837,
				"price": 800
			},
			{
				"date": "21/05/2024",
				"service": "Install Kitchen",
				"id": 129281,
				"price": 2000
			}
		],
		"totalCharge": 2800,
		"currency": "EUR"
	}
}
```
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<serviceBill>
	<customer>Steven Murphy</customer>
	<services>
		<item>
			<date>20/05/2024</date>
			<service>Kitchen Flooring</service>
			<id>122837></id>
			<price currency="EUR">800</price>
		</item>
		<item>
			<date>21/05/2024</date>
			<description>Install Kitchen</description>
			<id>129281</id>
			<price currency="EUR">2000</price>
		</item>
	</services>
	<totalCharge currency="EUR">2800</totalCharge>
</serviceBill>
```

## Question 3
### a)
Dynamic web applications are made up of web pages, based on the user and their interaction. Web pages are often personalized for each user, as the website information is made up from server-sided scripts. An example of this is the youtube website. Everyone's homepage is different, as they are tailored to the user.

Static web applications are webpages where all the information is stored already on the page. Every user who visits the website will see the same information. An example of this can be professional portfolios. Everyone who visits the website will see the same thing.

### b)
```php
<?php
$php = array("Array", "Function", "Strings", "File");
echo pos($php);
```
OUTPUT: "Array"
Because the current position/index is at 0

### c)
```php
<?php
	define("VAR_NAME", "test");
	${VAR_NAME} = "value";
	echo VAR_NAME;
	echo ${VAR_NAME};
?>
```
OUTPUT: "testvalue"

## d)
```php
$sql = "SELECT Student.StudentName, Student.studentID, Course.CourseID, Course.course
		FROM Student JOIN Study USING(StudentID) JOIN Course USING(CourseID)
		WHERE Study.ExamResult >70";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

echo "<table>";
echo "<tr>";
echo "<th>StudentName</th>";
echo "<th>StudentID</th>";
echo "<th>CourseName</th>";
echo "<th>CourseID</th>";
echo "<tr>";

if ($result->num_Rows > 0) {
	while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>" . $row['StudentName'] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $row['StudentID'] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $row['Course'] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $row['CourseID'] . "</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
}
echo "</table>";

mysqli_close($conn);
```
