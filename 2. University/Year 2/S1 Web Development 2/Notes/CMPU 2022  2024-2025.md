## Question 1
### a)


### b)
- Ease of use
- Price
- Security
- Support
- Functionality
- Operating System

Nginx
Apache
Microsoft Internet Information Services (ISS)

### c)
```php
<?php 
	function multi($num) 
	{ 
		if ($num == 3) echo "I Wonder"; 
		if ($num == 7) echo "Which One"; 
		if ($num == 8) echo "Is The"; 
		if ($num == 19) echo "Correct Answer"; 
	} 
	
	$can = stripos("I love php, I love php too!","PHP");
	multi($can); 
?>
```

Output: "Which One"

### d)
```php
<?php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "AerAirways");
if ($conn->connect_error) {
	die("Connection failed: ".$conn->connect_error);
}

$origin = $_GET['going_from'];

$sql = "SELECT Airport.country, Flight.flightNum
		FROM Flight JOIN Airport
		ON Flight.goingTo = Airport.airport
		WHERE Flight.GOingFrom = '$origin'
		ORDER BY Airport.country, Flight.flightNum;";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

$destination = [];
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
	$destination[$row['country']][] = $row['flightNum'];
}

echo "<ul>";
foreach ($destination as $country => $flights) {
	echo "<li>" . $country . "<ul>";
	foreach ($flights as $flight) {
		echo "<li>" . $flight . "</li>";
	}
	echo "</ul></li>";
}
echo "</ul>";

mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

## Question 2
### a)
XML
- XML is a markup language, using tags similar to HTML
- Data is placed between an open and close tag. "\<tag>\</tag>"
- There are no datatypes, everything is stored as a string

JSON
- JSON is a data interchange format, which uses key-value pairs and arrays
- It has support for various datatypes such as strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays
- Easier to read and understand than XML

### b)
How to define a function?
"function functionName(parameters) (function body)" 

### c)
```php
echo "\$x";
```

### d)
```json
{
	"serviceBill": {
		"customer": "Steven Murphy",
		"services": [
			{
				"date": "20,05,2024",
				"service": "Kitchen Flooring"
				"id": 122837,
				"price": 800
			},
			{
				"date": "21/05/2024",
				"service": "Install Kitchen",
				"id": 129281,
				"price": 2000
			}
		],
		"totalCharge": 2800,
		"currency": "EUR"
	}
}
```
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<serviceBill>
	<customer>Steven Murphy</customer>
	<services>
		<item>
			<date>20/05/2024</date>
			<service>Kitchen Flooring</service>
			<id>122837></id>
			<price currency="EUR">800</price>
		</item>
		<item>
			<date>21/05/2024</date>
			<description>Install Kitchen</description>
			<id>129281</id>
			<price currency="EUR">2000</price>
		</item>
	</services>
	<totalCharge currency="EUR">2800</totalCharge>
</serviceBill>
```

## Question 3
### a)
Dynamic web applications are made up of web pages, based on the user and their interaction. Web pages are often personalized for each user, as the website information is made up from server-sided scripts. An example of this is the youtube website. Everyone's homepage is different, as they are tailored to the user.

Static web applications are webpages where all the information is stored already on the page. Every user who visits the website will see the same information. An example of this can be professional portfolios. Everyone who visits the website will see the same thing.

### b)
```php
<?php
$php = array("Array", "Function", "Strings", "File");
echo pos($php);
```
OUTPUT: "Array"
Because the current position/index is at 0

### c)
```php
<?php
	define("VAR_NAME", "test");
	${VAR_NAME} = "value";
	echo VAR_NAME;
	echo ${VAR_NAME};
?>
```
OUTPUT: "testvalue"

## d)
```php
$sql = "SELECT Student.StudentName, Student.studentID, Course.CourseID, Course.course
		FROM Student JOIN Study USING(StudentID) JOIN Course USING(CourseID)
		WHERE Study.ExamResult >70";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

echo "<table>";
echo "<tr>";
echo "<th>StudentName</th>";
echo "<th>StudentID</th>";
echo "<th>CourseName</th>";
echo "<th>CourseID</th>";
echo "<tr>";

if ($result->num_Rows > 0) {
	while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>" . $row['StudentName'] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $row['StudentID'] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $row['Course'] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $row['CourseID'] . "</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
}
echo "</table>";

mysqli_close($conn);
```
