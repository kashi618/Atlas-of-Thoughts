## What is it?
It is a queue where each element has a priority. The highest priority is stored at the front, and will be the first one to be removed.

## Time Complexity

| Queue Type     | remove() | insert() |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Sorted Array   | O(1)     | O(n)     |
| Unsorted Array | O(n)     | O(1)     |
