## Signal Concepts
| Concept             | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spectrum            | The range of frequencies within a signal                   |
| Absolute Bandwidth  | The total width of the frequency spectrum                  |
| Effective Bandwidth | The practical frequency containing most of a signals power |
| D.C Component       | The zero-frequency component of a signal's spectrum        |


## Types of Signals
### Continuous
- At any point of time, there will always be a value
- There are no breaks or discontinuities
**Examples**

- Speech signals from microphones

### Discrete
- Sometimes there are a signal, sometimes there are none
- It contains a finite number of discrete values
**Examples**

- Computer/binary data

### Periodic
- A signal that repeats itself after a fixed time

### Aperiodic
- A signal with no repetition or distinct pattern
