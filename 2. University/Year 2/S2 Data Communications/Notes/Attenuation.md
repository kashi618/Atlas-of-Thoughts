## What is it?
When data is transmitted over long distances, the amplitude drops. This is called attenuation.

## How to Fix
**Analogues**
In analogue systems, we use an amplifier to amplify/boost the signal. However, noise becomes worse and worse, as it also amplifies its noise.

**Repeaters**
In digital systems, we use a repeater. Instead of "boosting" the signal like an amplifier,  it instead reads the data, and then repeats what the data says. However, due to it being digital, noise does NOT accumulate. it stays the same between repeaters

## Attenuation Distortion
A type of signal degradation that occurs when certain frequencies of a signal are attenuated, as they travel through a transmission medium.
