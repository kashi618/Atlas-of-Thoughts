### Flow Control
There are two main types of flow control techniques
#### Stop-and-Wait
- When the sending station transmits a frame, it must get an acknowledgement from the receiving station, before transmitting the next frame. This is called an **ACK**
- The receiving station can then control the flow of data, by withholding ACKs
- However, this technique only allows for the transmission of a single frame, in one direction. i.e. half duplex communications. Due to this, it leads to poor link utilization
