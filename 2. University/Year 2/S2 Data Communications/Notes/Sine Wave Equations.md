## General Sine Wave Equation
**$s(t)=A\sin(2\pi.ft+\emptyset$**

$A=Amplitude$
The peak value of the wave

$f=Frequency$
The number of repetitions per second. Measured in Hertz (Hz)

$t=Time$
The time representing the instant, when amplitude is evaluated. Measured in seconds (s)

$\emptyset=Phase$
The measure of the relative position within a cycle of a signal

When the two left waves are added togethor, you get the second wave
