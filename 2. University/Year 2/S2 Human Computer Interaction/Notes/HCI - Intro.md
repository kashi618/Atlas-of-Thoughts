## What is HCI?
Human-Computer Interaction is:
"...concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of  
interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of  
major phenomena surrounding them." (ACM SIGCHI, 1992, p.6)

It is the study on the interaction between people and computers, and the development of principles, guidelines, and methods to support the design and evaluation of interactive systems.
