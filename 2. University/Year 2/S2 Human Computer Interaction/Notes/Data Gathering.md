## Interviews
There are three types of interviews:
1. **Unstructured**
   Not defined by a script. Can be rich in information, but is not replicable
2. **Semi-structured**
   Guided by a script, but interesting issues/ideas that come up can be explored
3. **Structured**
   Tightly scripted, similar to a questionnaire. Is very replicable, but may lack richness

### Interview Questions
There are two types:
- **Closed questions**
