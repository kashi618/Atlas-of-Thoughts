## Single-Threading
Single threading is when one thread is used per process
- It is simple, predictable, and does not run into any race problems when accessing memory
- Used only for simple sequential lightweight processes

## Multi-Threading
Multi-threading is when multiple threads are ran together in a process
- This improves performance on multi core CPU's, due to concurrency and paralellism
- More responsive, as it allows a program to do multiple tasks at once
