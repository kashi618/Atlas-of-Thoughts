## What is a Process
- An instance of a program that is being executed. It is what "runs" when a program is started
- Each process is independent, meaning they do **NOT** share resources with other processes of the same program
- A program can contain many processes

### Process Characteristics
Each process contains:
- Code/instructions from the program
- Data allocated in the heap and stack; containing variables and data. Each process has has their own separate memory
- **Program counter**; which stores the next instruction to be executed
- **Unique PID** (process identification) used to uniquely identify the process
