## What is it?
A technique where a system's requirements and behaviour are described using mathematical notation, instead of natural language such as English.

### Advantages
- Eliminates ambiguity, as everything has a strict and single meaning
- Due to being a mathematical model, we can use "model checkers" to prove if the system is logically sound and works

### Disadvantages
- Is complex, and requires more time and money to convert requirements into formal specification.
- Hard for stakeholders to understand, as it requires specialized knowledge when compared to natural language (English)
