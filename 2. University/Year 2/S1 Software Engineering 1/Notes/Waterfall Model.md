## What is it?
It is a linear and structured approach to developing a piece of software. It is structured in phases, where each phase is fully completed before moving to the next.

## Phases
### Requirements Gathering
Developers gather all the requirements needed from the system,through meetings with the stakeholders and potential users

### Systems Design
It is how the requirements will be designed by the developers. This involves what classes, objects, and relationships are needed.


### Implementation
The design is then converted into actual code, to produce a piece of software

### Integration and Testing
This software is then tested until it is a complete system, and that it meets all the requirements needed

### Deployment and Maintenance
The software is now deployed and can be used by the stakeholders/customers. This phase fixes any bugs found during usage, and updates the system for additional needs

## Pros and Cons
### Pros

### Cons
- Due to the structured approach for finishing each phase before going to the next, it is very difficult to add or make changes after the project moves into the design or implementation stage
- Major bugs which can occur in the implementation stage may not be found until later, during the testing stage. This can cause major bugs to slip through, and be costly to find and fix
