## What is it?
The systematic process of discovering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements needed for a piece of software. It is used as a bridge that translates what the customer/stakeholder needs, into goals for the developer to build the software.

## Activities
### Feasibility Study
Estimates the required resources, to determine if the proposed system is worth developing and cost-effective

### Elicitation and Analysis
Derives the system requirements through interaction with the stakeholders/customers, and potential users

### Specification
Gathered requirements are written in a formal and technical documentation

### Validation
The requirements are then checked for realism, consistency, and completeness
