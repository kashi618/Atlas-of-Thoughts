## Using Prime Factorization to Find GCD and LCM

**38808**
2^3 x 3^2 x 5^0 7^2 x 11^1

**103950**
2^1 x 3^3 x 4^0 x 5^2 x 7^1 x 11^1

GCD (38808, 103950) = 2^1 x 3^2 x 4^0 x 5^0 x 7^1 x 11^1 = 1,386
LCM (38808, 103950) = 2^3 x 3^3 x 5^2 x 7^2 x 11^1 = 2,910,600

### How to Check Answer
- The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of the GCM and LCM on the two numbers.
38808 x 103950 = 4,034,091,600
GCD x LCM = 1,368 x 2,910,600 = 4,034,091,600

## Euclidian Algorithm
**a = q (b) + r**

- Finds the GCD between any two integers, provided the integer is set up as followed.
- If A and B are the two integers, where (a>b)\
  a = q (b) + r
  q = Quotient, how many times A divides into B
  r = Remainder, what is left over

### Examples
**a = 42823     b = 6409**
42823 = q (6409) + r
42823 = 6 (6409) + 4369

6409 = q (4369) + r
6409 = 1 (4369) + 2040

4369 = q (2040) + r
4369 = 2 (2040) + 289

2040 = q (289) + r
2040 = 7 (289) + **17**

289 = q (17) + r
289 = 17 (17) + 0

- The last NON zero remainder is the answer
- GCD (42823, 6409) = **17**

**a = 7469     b = 2464**
7469 = 3 (2464) + 77
2464 = 32 (77) + 0
