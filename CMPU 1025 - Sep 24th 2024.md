## Incrementing Numbers

``` c
// This adds one to var1
var1 = var1 + 1;

// This does the same, however is simpler
var1++;
```

### Deincrementing Numbers
``` c
// This removes one to var1
var1 = var1 - 1;

// This does the same, however is simpler
var1--;
```

## Redundant Code
- Code that doesn't do anything
``` c
var1 = var1 * 1;
var1 = var1 / 1;
```
- Althought this does nothing, it still uses resources and is wasteful

## Object and Procedural Languages
C is a procedural Language
C++ is a object oriented language
