## 3

*Don't honor good men, and the people will not strive.*
*Don't value rare goods, and the people will not steal.*
*Don't show off valuables, and the peoples' hearts will not be confused.*

*Thus, the wise ruler empties minds and fills stomachs,*
*Weakens ambitions and strengthens bones.*

*Make sure the people have no knowledge and no desire.*
*Those who have knowledge will not dare to act!*

*Do without doing, and all will be peaceful*

If good men arn't honoured, then they will not be good men.
Yet, if you dont value goods, then you will not desire to steal.
If you dont show off, people wont be confused?

The ruler, or king, should empty their desires and fill up stomaches. After all, hunger is a way of nature?

But we do know that, those who are knowledgeable, and understand, will have no desires. They will never think of acting.
