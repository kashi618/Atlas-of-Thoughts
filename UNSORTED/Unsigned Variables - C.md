 - Removes the negative range of a variable, and adding the extra memory to the positive side.
  Range of unsigned integer, range = 0 > 4 billion

unsigned int num1;
unsigned char char1;
unsigned bool bool1;
```

- For unsigned variables, add "u" before the delimeter
int = %uf, char = %uc, bool = %ub, etc
