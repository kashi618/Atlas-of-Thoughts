## Neural Networks
- Required lots of data, to work

## Traditional Programming
- Define set of rules.
- Program rules into computer.
- Feed examples, and the program uses rules to classify.
## Deep Learning
- Show model examples of how to answer questions.
- Model takes guesses, well tell it if its right or not.
- Model learns to correctly categorize as its training, learning the rules on its own.

### When to Use or Not to Use Deep Learning
**Classic Programming**
- Should be used if rules are clear and straightforward.
**Deep Learning**
- When rules are nuanced, complex, and difficult to discern.
