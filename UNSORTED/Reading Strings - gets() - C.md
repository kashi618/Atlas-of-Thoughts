## gets()
Built in function in C, that can read a string from standard input (keyboard, etc)
It will read all characters typed, including whitespace characters and newline character (enter key)
**NOTE:** THIS FUNCTION IS GONNA BECOME DEPRICATED, MEANING don't use it :)

```c showlinenumbers
// Gets user input
gets(name);
// Prints user input
puts(name);
```
