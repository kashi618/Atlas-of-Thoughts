## Casting
- Casting in C, allows us to convert a variable from one type to another
- **IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE ORIGINAL VARIABLE TYPE.** It only changes it for that specific line/calculation.

### Explicit Casting

``` c
// The test variable is now a float
float test = 10.75;
// This now turns test into an integer
int newTest = (int)test


// age is a integer
int age = 10;
// now it changes age into a float
float message = (float)age;
```
- Explicit casting is when you manually cast a variable.
- IE. you manually change a variable type from one to another


### Implicit Casting
``` c
int var1 = 1
float var2 = 1.5

float answer

// var1 is cast into a float, through implicit casting
answer = var1 + var2
```
- Implicit casting is when the compilar automatically casts a variable
- ie. a variable is chan
