## Congruence/Congruent Modulo Numbers
23 = **3** (mod 10)
	23/10 = 2 remainder **3**
	10 divides into 23-3 = 10
**3** is the congruent number

23 = **7** (mod 8)
	23/8 = 1 remainder **7**
	8 divides into 23-7 = 16
**7** is the congruent number

10,000 = **4** (mod 7)
	10,000/7 = 1428 remainder **4**
	7 divides into 10,000-4 = 1428
**4** is the congruent number
