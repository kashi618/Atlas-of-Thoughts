## Congruence/Congruent Modulo Numbers
23 = **3** (mod 10)
	23/10 = 2 remainder **3**
	10 divides into 23-3 = 10
**3** is the congruent number

23 = **7** (mod 8)
	23/8 = 1 remainder **7**
	8 divides into 23-7 = 16
**7** is the congruent number

10,000 = **4** (mod 7)
	10,000/7 = 1428 remainder **4**
	7 divides into 10,000-4 = 1428
**4** is the congruent number


| mod6 | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0    | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| 1    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 0   |

| 5    | 5   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |

## Negative Modulus Numbers
Add the mod, until you get a positive number

-4 (mod5) = 1
	-4 + 5 = 1
-29 (mod32) = 3
	-29 + 32 = 3
-19 (mod10) = 1
	-19 + 10 + 10 = 1
-102 (mod12) = 6

## Inverses in Modulus Numbers

Two numbers are inverse if when you mutliply then, you get 1

### Normal Number Systems
normal number = 2
inverse number = 1/2

2 x 1/2 = 1

However, there are no fractions in modular number systems

So instead of 1/2, you write 2<sup>-1</sup>

### Modular Number Systems
The inverse of 2, in (mod 3) is 2


| x     | 0   | 1   | **2** |
| ----- | --- | --- | ----- |
| 0     | 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 1     | 0   | 1   | 2     |
| **2** | 0   | 2   | **1** |

#### Inverse Numbers Exampls
The inverse of 3<sup>-1</sup> (mod11) is 4
	3<sup>-1</sup> = 4 (mod11) 
	3x4 = 12 = 1(mod11)

The inverse of 5^-1 (mod 12) is
	5^-1 = 5 (mod 12)
	5x5 = 10 =

 Two Ways to Find Inverse of a Number
### Fermats Little Theorem
Can be used to find the inverse of a number, if the **mod p IS a prime**.
Let **p be a prime number**, and suppose **a is an integer** and is **NOT divisible by p**
a<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>p-2</sup> (mod p)

Find the inversze of 5 (mod7)
5<sup>-1</sup> = 5<sup>7-2</sup> 
5<sup>-1</sub> = 5<sup>5</sup>
5<sup>-1</sup> = 3125
5<sup>-1</sup> = 3

Use Fermats Little Theorem to find the inverse of 6 (mod 11)
6<sup>-1</sup> = 6<sup>11-2</sup>
6<sup>-1</sup> = 6<sup>9</sup>
6<sup>-1</sup> = 10,077,696
6<sup>-1</sup> = 2

The inverse of 6 (mod11) is 2

### Euclidean Algorithm
Can be used to find the inverse of a number, if the **mod p is NOT a prime.**
b = q(a) + r

Find the inverse of 11<sup>-1</sup> (mod 80)

gcd(11, 80)

80 = 7(11) + 3
11 = 3(3) + 2
3 = 1(2) + 1
2 = 2(2) + 0
gcd(11, 80) = 1

11x + 80y = 1
1(3)  - 1(2) = 1
1(3) - 1(11 - 3(3)) = 1
1(3) - 1(11) +3(3) = 1
4(3) - 1(11) = 1
...
...
...
11 = -29 (mod 80)
11 = 51 (mod 80)

Find the inverse of 17 (mod64)

gcd(64, 17) = 0
64 = 3(17) + 13
17 = 1(13) + 4
13 = 3(4) + 1
4 = 4(1) + 0

~~~
64x + 17y = 1
1(13) - 3(4) = 1
1(13) - 3(17 - 1(13)) = 1
1(13) - 3(17) - 1(13) = 1

2(14) - 3(17) = 1
2(14) - 1(())
~~~


## Caesar's Cipher
Use Caesar's cipher with key=3 to encode:
Plaintext (p) = ARE YOU READY
Ciphertext (c) = DUH BRX U
