In order to print out or store data inside of variables, a demiliter is needed to specifiy the type of data you want to print out/store.

| Delimeter | Type                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| %d        | Integer                               |
| %f        | Float                                 |
| %c        | Character                             |
| %p        | [[Pointers - C]]                      |
| %s        | [[Strings - C (SEPARATE SOME STUFF)]] |
