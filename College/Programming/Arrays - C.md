## Contiguous
The values in an array is a contiguous block of data
It is not scattered in different parts
One uniform block

## Setting Entire Array to One Value
- Set the value of the array by using curly brackets {0}
- The array now contains 100 zero's

``` cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
	int AllZero[100] = {0};
}
```
