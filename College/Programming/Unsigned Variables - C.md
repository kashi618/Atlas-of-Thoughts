Removes the negative range of a variable, and adding the extra memory to the positive side
A regular int has a range of (-2 billion <-> 2 billion)
A unsigned int has a range of (0 <-> 4 billion)
```c showlinenumbers
unsigned int num1;
unsigned char char1;
unsigned bool bool1;
```

- For unsigned variables, add "u" before the delimeter
int = %uf, char = %uc, bool = %ub, etc
