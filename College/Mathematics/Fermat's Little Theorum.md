Can be used to find the inverse of a number, if the **mod p IS a prime**.
Let **p be a prime number**, and suppose **a is an integer** and is **NOT divisible by p**
a<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>p-2</sup> (mod p)

Find the inversze of 5 (mod7)
5<sup>-1</sup> = 5<sup>7-2</sup> 
5<sup>-1</sub> = 5<sup>5</sup>
5<sup>-1</sup> = 3125
5<sup>-1</sup> = 3

Use Fermats Little Theorem to find the inverse of 6 (mod 11)
6<sup>-1</sup> = 6<sup>11-2</sup>
6<sup>-1</sup> = 6<sup>9</sup>
6<sup>-1</sup> = 10,077,696
6<sup>-1</sup> = 2

The inverse of 6 (mod11) is 2
