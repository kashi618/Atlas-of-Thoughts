The biggest number that divides between 2 numbers

## Finding the GCD
GCD(24,80)
24 has factors of 1, 2, 4, 6, **8**, 12, 24
80 has factors of 1, 2, 4, 5, **8**, 10, 16, 20, 40, 80
The GCD is 8

## Finding GCD Using Prime Factorization
To find the GCD using prime factors, take the smallest power of each common prime

GCD(2100,17640)
2100 has prime factors of **2<sup>2</sup>** x **3** x 5<sup>2</sup> x **7**
17640 has prime factors of 2<sup>3</sup> x 3<sup>2</sup> x **5** x 7<sup>2</sup>
The GCD is (2<sup>2</sup> x 3 x 5 x 7) = 420
