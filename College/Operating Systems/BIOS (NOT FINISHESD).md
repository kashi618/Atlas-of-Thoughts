The role of the BIOS is to load the operating system
- The BIOS provides the instructions

*******
The BIOS is special software stored on a chip located on  
the system unit  
– Its main role is to load the operating system  
• When you turn on your computer and the microprocessor tries to execute its  
first instruction, it has to get that instruction from somewhere  
• But since the Operating System is located on the hard disk before boot-up, the  
CPU cannot get this initial instruction from the OS  
• So the BIOS provides these initial instructions
