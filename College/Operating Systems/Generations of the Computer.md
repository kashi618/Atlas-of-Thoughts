## First Generation 1945-1955
- Based on **vacuum tubes** and plug boards
- Programs were entered by human operators setting switches
- Computationally very slow, and primarily used for scientific calculation

## Second Generation 1955-1965
- Based on **transistors**
- Universities started to buy computers
- Programs ran on punched cards
- Computers were single user

## Third Generation 1965-1980
- Based on **integrated circuits** and **multiprogramming**
- Spooling was used (simultaneous peripheral operation on-line)
- Multiprogramming is when multiple jobs are stored in memory. When one job is completed, the next is done, an so on.
- The father of all modern OS's MULTICS was developed (multiplexed information and computing service), which eventually lead to the development of UNIX
