The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is used to store instructions that holds how to start a machine.

The BIOS is special software stored on a chip located on  
the system unit  
- Its main role is to load the operating system  
- When you turn on your computer and the microprocessor tries to execute its  
first instruction, it has to get that instruction from somewhere  
- But since the Operating System is located on the hard disk before boot-up, the  
CPU cannot get this initial instruction from the OS  
- So the BIOS provides these initial instructions
- x^N = A
- LOG A z = N
