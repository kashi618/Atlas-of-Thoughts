## Program Design
It is about how to get a computer to do what you want
- Flowcharts
- Pseudocode
- Boolean algebra
- Abstrction
- And the steps performed, to arrive at a solution
- NOT A PROGRAMMING CLASS !
- Open notebook class

## Assessment
- Written exam = 60%
- CA = 40%

## Books
- Problem solving and Programming Concepts - Sprankle and Hubbard
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/

## Terminology
- **Generalisation**
  Making a solution applicable not just in a concrete case, but useful for more general cases
- **Abstraction**
  Hiding the details of a soluction, only making the information imporant to the ucrrent context
- **Low/High level**
  Low level = Closer to machine level
  High level = Closer to human level

### Computational Thinking
1. **Decomposition**
   Breaking down complex problems into a sequence of easier problems
2. **Pattern Recognition**
   Finding similarities and patterns in problems, to solve other similar problems
3. **Abstraction**
   Hiding the details of a soluction, only making the information imporant to the current context
4. **Algorithms**
   The final sequence of percise instructions
-
1. **Define** the problem
	Find and understand the problem
2. **Outline** the solution
	Divide the problem into smaller steps
	Think of anologies and patterns, have I seen 
	Experiment
3. **Develop** the outline into an algorithm
	Translate the solution to the problem, into machine readable code, and 
4. **Test** algorithm for correctness
	Test with inputs that you know the output for
	Change and improve if doesn't work
-
*There are often many different approaches and solutions to problems*
