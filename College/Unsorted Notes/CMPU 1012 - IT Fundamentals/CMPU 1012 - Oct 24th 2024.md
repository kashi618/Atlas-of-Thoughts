## Electrical Computers
- Modern computers use electricity
- Electrical computing began in the last year or two of the 1930s, as experimental adding machines

## Generations of Hardware
There are 4 major generations in computer hardware, and some say we are in the midst of the fifth generation.

### First Generation - Vacuum Tube Technology
- Vacuum Tube Technology (1945 - 1956)
- This generation of computers relied on vacuum tubes to store and process information
- However, they consumed alot of power,  were short-lived, and generated a huge amount of heat
- They were hug machines, but with limited memory and processing capability, used only for very limited scientific and engineering work

#### Speeds and Memory
- The main memory size was around 200 bytes
- Speed was aobut 10,000 instructions per second.

#### Vacuum Tubes
- Glass tubed with circuits inside
- They contained no air, which protects the circuitry
- It was invented due to the [[Edison Effect]].


### Second Generation - Transistors
- Transistors (1857 - 1963)
- Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, due to its:
	- Stability
	- Reliability
	- Less Heat Generated
	- Less power consumed
- They were a kind of semiconductor amplifier, as when an electrical current came through the inward contact, another even stronger current came out the other contact.
- Transistors could either let lots of current through or let none through.

#### Core Memory
Magnetic core memory was the primary storage technolgy used in this generation.
They were small magnetic rings, around 1mm in diameter. Each ring could be polarised in one of two direction, to represent a data bit, a 1 or a 0.
Wires was then strung through the cores to allow the ability to write and read data. 
Core memory was very expensive, as they had to be assembled by hand

#### Speed and Memory
- Had up to 32kb of RAM
- Speeds of 200,000 - 300,000 instructions per second

### Third Generation - Integerated Circuits
- Integrated Circuits (1964 - 1979)
- These circuit boards were made by printing hundreds, and sometimes thousands of tiny transistors on small silicon chips
- These devices are called semiconductors
- Special software called operating systems were needed, as they automated the running of the programs and communications between the CPU, prints, and other output and input devices
- They also came with software which could be used by the average person, without the need for extensive technical training

#### MITS Altair
- Invented in 1975, it contained 256 bytes of memory
- It had the 2MHz Intel 8080 chips
- Just a box with flashing lights

#### Speeds and Memory
- Contained up tp 2MB of RAM
- Speeds of around 5 million instructions per second, (5 MIPS)


### Fourth Generation - Large-Scale Integrated Circuits
- In the generation, costs for computers are fallen, making computers relatively inexpensive and available for use in business and everyday life.
- Memory capacity has gone up to 8-16GB.
