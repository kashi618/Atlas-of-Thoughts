## Exam Mathematics
- Euclidean Algorithmn 1+2
- Modular Arithmetic (Multiplication and Inverse, mod5 etc)

## Indices and Logarithms
Any expression written as x<sup>n</sup> is defined as the variable (base) x raised to the power of n, ie. x multiplyed by itself n times.
### Example 
2<sup>6</sup> = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 

## Negative Powers
$$3^2=\frac{1}{3^2}$$

## Square Roots, Cubed Roots, etc
$$\sqrt{x}=\left(x\right)^{\frac12}$$

3sqrt(w) = w^(1/3)

## Rules of Indices
$\huge a^m * a^n = a{m+n}$

$\huge 3^4/3^2 = 3^(4-2)$

$\huge \frac{3^4}{3^2} = 3^{4-2}$

$\huge (a^m)^n$

## Power to Log
$\huge 3^2=9\to \log_{3}9=2$

## Rules of Logs
