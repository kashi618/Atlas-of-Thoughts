# Dereference Operator
Indirection Operator IS the dereference operator
Used to access the actual value/contents of an address location, stored in a pointer variable. Finds the value of an address location.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH CREATING VARIABES (int \*ptr1)
``` c
*pointerName
```

``` c
int var1 = 10;
int *ptr1;

ptr1 = &var1;

// The dereference operator is used here
printf("%d",*ptr1);
```
