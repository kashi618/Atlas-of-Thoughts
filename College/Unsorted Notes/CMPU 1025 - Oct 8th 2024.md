## Switch Statements - C
- An alternative to if else statements, however, it is more efficient and faster



## Assigning Multiple Variables on One Line - C
``` c
float var1,var2,var3 = 0;

float var1 = 0, var2 = 0, var3 = 0
```
- Line 1 does NOT work, since var1 and var2 are not given any values
- Line 2 does work, as each is given a value

## Scanf Ignore Whitespace Characters - C
``` c
int var1 = 0;
scanf(" %f", var1)
```
- Add a space before OR after the delimeter
