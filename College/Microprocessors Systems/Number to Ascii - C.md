We have number 253
On the ascii table,
- Num 2 = Ascii Val 50
- Num 5 = Ascii Val 53
- Num 3 = Ascii Val 51

 How would be get the numbers 2, 5, 3 on its own then?

To get the first digit 3,
253 MOD 10 = 3

To get the second digit 5,
253 DIVIDE(noremainder) 10 = 25
25 MOD 10 = 5

To get the third digit 3,
253 DIVIDE(noremainder) 100 = 
2
