## Hexadecimal to Binary
We want to convert E5FA to binary
For each digit in the hexadecimal, we can represent it in binary with 0 zeros
In this case, we need 4 groups of zeros
We then convert one hex digit at a time to binary

```
 E    5    F    A
1110 0101 1111 1010
```

```
0  = 0000
1  = 0001
2  = 0010
3  = 0011
4  = 0100
5  = 0101
6  = 0110
7  = 0111
8  = 1000
9  = 1001
10 = 1010
11 = 1011
12 = 1100
13 = 1101
14 = 1110
15 = 1111
16 = 
```
