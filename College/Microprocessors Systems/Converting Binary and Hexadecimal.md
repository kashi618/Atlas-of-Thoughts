## Hexadecimal to Binary
We want to convert E5FA to binary
For each digit in the hexadecimal, we can represent it in binary with 0 zeros
In this case, we need 4 groups of zeros
We then convert one hex digit at a time to binary

```
 E    5    F    A
1110 0101 1111 1010
```

```
HEX    BINARY
 0  =  0000
 1  =  0001
 2  =  0010
 3  =  0011
 4  =  0100
 5  =  0101
 6  =  0110
 7  =  0111
 8  =  1000
 9  =  1001
 A  =  1010
 B  =  1011
 C  =  1100
 D  =  1101
 E  =  1110
 F  =  1111 
```
