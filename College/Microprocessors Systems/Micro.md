## Question 1
### A)
#### (i) 0xEF00 & (1<<15)
```
  1110 1111 0000 0000
& 0100 0000 0000 0000
  0100 0000 0000 0000
```

#### (ii) 0x28A8 | 0xA645
```
  0010 1000 1010 1000
| 1010 0110 0100 0101
  1110 1110 1110 1101
```
### B)
```
What value will X have after the following C-code fragment?
int8_t X; // X is a signed 8 bit number
X = -125;
X = X – 5;
```

- 8bit number means the highest amount that can be stored is 256 numbers
- That means, it is between -128 to 0 to 127
```
-128, -127, -126, -125, ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., 126, 127
```

The answer is 126

### C) 
```
A computer system is required to store unsigned numbers in the range 0 to 8191. What is the minimum number of bits required to store one of these numbers?
```

The answer is 13 bits
This is because 2^13 = 8192

### E)

#### (i)
```
A serial communications link which operates with even parity checking sends the character ‘A’. Will the parity bit associated with this transmission be 1 or 0?
```
