## Assessment
- CA = 30%
	- Monday 14th October (**week 5**)
	- Monday 18th November  (**week 10**)
- Exam = 70%

## Modules
- Number theory
- Indices & Logarithmns
- Set Theory
- Relations & Functions
- Sequenes & Series
- Propositional Logic
- Matrices
- Statistics

## Number Theory
- Integers (Positive and negative WHOLE numbers)
- Product (Two or more numbers MULTIPLIED by eachother)
- Factor (A number that can divide into another numbers)

*2 x 7 = 14*
2 and 7 are factors
14 is product

### Prime Factors 
Numbers that only 1 and itself are factors
	1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, etc

### Factorizing Integers
Find all factors of an integer

*Find the prime factors of 231*
3 x 77
<u>3 x 7 x 11</u>

## Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every integer can be uniquely written as the product of prime factors

## Highest Common Factor/Greatest Common Divisor
The biggest factor common between 2 or more numbers.

*What is the GCD of 24 and 80*
24 has 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
80 has 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, 80
gcd(24,80) = 8

- Listing out all factors are slow, look at [Prime Factorization]
### Prime Factorization
Find the GCD by finding out **only** the prime factors. This is both easier and faster than finding out all the factors of a number.

*what is the GCD of 210 and 720*
210 = 2^1 x 3^1 x 5^1 x 7^1
720 = 2^4 x  3^2 x 5^1 x 7^0
TO find the gcd, use the smallest power of each common factor
gcd(210,720) = 2^1 x 3^1 x 5^1 x 7^0 = 30

#### Lowest Common Multiple
Instead of finding the product of the smallest power of each prime factor, find the product of the BIGGEST power of each prime factor.
lcm(210,720) = 2^4 x 3^2 x 5^1 x 7^1 = 5040
