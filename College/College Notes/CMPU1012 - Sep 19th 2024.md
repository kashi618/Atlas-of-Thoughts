## Static and Dynamic Information
- Static information doesn't change over time, such as books
- Dynamic information changes overtime, such as the technology of computers 

## Important Aspects of Computers
- Speed
- Reliability
- Consistency
- Storage
- Communications

## What is Technology?
- It is when humans use objects such as tools, systems materials, to change the natural and human-made environment
- IT is developed by people to modify their environment

### Information Technology
- It is the technology involving the development, maintenance, and use of computer systems, software, and networks for thep processing and distribution of data

## Use of Computers
- Many things used in the past, are being replaced by machines and computers
  - Such as typewriters
- Computers are also use to control car engines, to help improve fuel efficiency
- Using computers, we are also able to provide completely new services that had not existed before
	- The Internet and World Wide Web are tehcnologies with a profound impact on sosciety
- Many people are now also able to work from home, due to causes such as long commute times, and pandemics such as COVID 19
- Computers can also be used to control machines that may have I/O devices that humans cannot interact with. Such as:
	- Thermometers to record temperature
	- Pressure sensors
	- Relays to control valves

## Embedded computers
- They are the most basic computers that we use
- Often designed for a specific purpose, such as the control of a car engine
### Microcontroller
- The processor used in an embedded computer is known as the Microcontroller

## Convergence (RESEARCH MORE)
- Computers are ubiquitous
- They can merge with other devices in a process known as convergence

Phones contain computers
- Washing machine contain computers
- Computers can emulate phones
- Computers can emulate television

## Types of Computers
- Smartphones
- Laptops
- Desktop PC's
- Workstations
- Networking Compujters
- Mini and micro computers
- Servers     
- Mainframes
- Supercomputers

Mainframes are sometimes reffered to as a supercomputer

### Mainframes / Supercomputers
- Extremely powerful and large machines
- Professtions such as meteorology may require the need of these super fast computers
- Often they support a huge number of users
- Used to store and process a huge amount of data
- Extremely expensive, organisations often hire the services of a vendor who has these computers
- Originally they were known as the "big brothers" of the PC's we have at home
- They are made to be as powerful as possible, with no expense spared

### Servers
- The definition of a server is the software program that manages the high-volume and hihg-traffic computing.
- However now, they are mostly known and used for either large volume computation, managing data, or managing network traffics
### Network Computers
- A network is a collection of connected PC's
- However a Network Interfrace Card will be needed to connect and share information between other PC's
**Examples such as:**
- LAN
- WAN
- MAN
- Internet
