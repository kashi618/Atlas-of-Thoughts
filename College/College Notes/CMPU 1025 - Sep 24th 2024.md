## Incrementing Numbers

``` c
// This adds one to var1
var1 = var1 + 1;

// This does the same, however is simpler
var1++;
```

### Deincrementing Numbers
``` c
// This removes one to var1
var1 = var1 - 1;

// This does the same, however is simpler
var1--;
```

## Pre and Post Incrementing
``` c
/* 
Post Incrementing
This first assigns var1 the value of var2, and THEN increments var2 by 1
This means var1=1 var2=2
*/
var1 = var2++;

/* 
Pre Incrementing
This first increments var2 by one, and THEN it assigns the value of var2 to var 1 
This means var1=2 var2=2
*/
var1 = ++var2;
```
## Redundant Code
- Code that doesn't do anything
``` c
var1 = var1 * 1;
var1 = var1 / 1;

var1 + var2;
```
- Althought this does nothing, it still uses resources and is wasteful

## Object and Procedural Languages
C is a procedural Language
C++ is a object oriented language

## Operating Precedence
- NO bomdas or pemdas

| Operator    | Precedence | Meaning                                | Other                                             |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Brackets    | Highest    | Brackets have the highest precedence   |                                                   |
| -           | Higher     | Unary minus (Not Minus)                | e.g.<br>int a = 10;<br>int b = -a +2 *5:<br>b = 0 |
| *<br>/<br>% | High       | Multiplication<br>Division<br>Mopdulus | Left to Right                                     |
| +<br>-      | Low        | Addition<br>Subtraction<br>            | Left to Right                                     |
- **Quite confusing, so just put everything in brackets**
- Brackets don't act as multiplication. 
  (6 + 2)6, This won't work
