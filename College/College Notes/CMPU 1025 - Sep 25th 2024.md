## Strongly and Weakly Typed Languages
- C is an example of a strongly typed language
	- When declaring variables, the type of variable also needs to be declared.
- Python is an example of a weakly typed language
	- When declaring variables, it will auto choose the type of variable it is

## Mixed Expressions
``` cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int   int1;
    int   int2;
    float float1;
    float float2;

//  Example 1
    printf("Example 1:\n");
	
    int1   = 10;
    float1 = 2.5;
    float2 = 0;
    
    // This is a mixed expression, as it divides an integer and a float
    float2 = int1 / float1; 
    printf("Float2 has a value of %f\n\n",float2);

// Example 2
    printf("Example 2:\n");
	
    float1 = 0;
    int1   = 10;
    int2   = 8;
	
    // This won't give the correct value, as 10 / 8 is not 2
    float1 = int1 / int2;
    printf("Float1 has a value of %f\n\n",float1);

// Fixing Example 2
    printf("Fixing Example 2:\n");
	
    float1 = 0;
    int1   = 10;
    int2   = 8;
	
    // You can fix it by making one of the integers a float
    float1 = (float)int1 / int2;
    printf("Float1 has a value of %f\n",float1);
	
    return 0;
}
```
