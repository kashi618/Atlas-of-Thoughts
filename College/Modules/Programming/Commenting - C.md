In all programming languages, commenting is highly recommended

## Single-Line Comment
Single line comments use a "//"

```c showlinenumbers
int main(void) {
	// cool single line comment here
	// here comes another single line comment
}
```

## Multi-Line Comment
Multi-line comments begin with a "/\*" and end with a "/\*". They can span across many lines
```c showlinenumbers
int main(void) {
	/*  
		This
		is
		a
		very
		long
		comment
		spanning
		many
		lines
	*/
}
```
