**Note:** Also known as a macro

Symbolic names are often used to avoid hard coding the same value repeatedly.
```c showlinenumbers
#define AGE    18
#define PI     3.1415
#define LETTER 'A'
```
- The format of a symbolic name should be in all caps, to differentiate them from regular variables
- If a program is running, the value of a symbolic name **CANNOT** be changed
