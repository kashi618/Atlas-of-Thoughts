Very annoying bug
This is when a string doesn't have a NULL character, therefore the string has no ending

## Example
The array does not have enough space to store the NULL character, therefore, the compiler will continue to print out random data in memory, as the string has to termination point 

`char greeting[5] = "Hello";
