**I/Burst**
Time interval for when a process only uses the I/O

## Types of Scheduling
**Non pre-emptive**
This is when a processes runs to completion
(very rare in modern operating systems)

**Pre-emptive Scheduling**
A process may be temporarily halted in order for another process to run
The halted process goes to a ready state
- A processes is only assigned to the cpu for a certain time period. After, it is sent back to the queue

## CPU Dispatcher
Takes whatever process the cpu scheduler chooses to runs on the cpu, and actually runs it on the cpu
