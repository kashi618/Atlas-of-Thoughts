## Before Von Neumann
Computers used hard-wired physical switches that data was sent through.
This was an extremely slow process, as changing one thing could take months to check

## After Von Neumann
Von Neumann proposed a new way to store and run programs. His idea was to store common instructions in memory, alongside with the data.
1. Data and instructions are stored in memory as binary digits
2. Instructions are fetched from memory, one at a time in order
3. The processor then decodes the instruction and then executes
