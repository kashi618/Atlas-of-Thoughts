## Key Components of a CPU
![[Pasted image 20250210142701.png|250]]
1. CU - Control unit
2. ALU - Arithmetic logic Unit
3. Buses
4. Registers
5. Clock

## Control Unit (CU)
The CU understands instructions, and tells the other components what each instruction needs from them
It manages instructions, and controls other components

## Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
The calculator of the CPU, it handles all mathematical and logical operations required in an instruction

## Buses
A CPU bus is a set of wires that connect and transport data between the components in a CPU and memory
It manages the flow of data around the CPU and memory

## Registers
There are 2 main types of registers

### Current Instruction Register
This register holds the binary representation of the instruction about to be executed

### Program Counter
This register counts and keeps track of instructions that are executed in a program

## Clock
The clock in a CPU is used to regulate the number of cycles carried out per second, and to synchronise with the other components
