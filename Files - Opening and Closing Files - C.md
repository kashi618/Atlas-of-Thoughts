When dealing with files in C, you must first open the file. Opening a file allows you to read, write, and access a file.

## Opening a File
Opening a file is done using the `fopen()` command. However, before opening a file, a file pointer must be created. The file pointer links

```c showlinenumbers
#include <stdio.h>

fopen()
```
