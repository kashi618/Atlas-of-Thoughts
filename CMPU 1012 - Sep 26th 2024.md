**RESEARCH MORE ON MODELLING**


## Information Technlogy
- Information Technology is the storing, retreiving, and sending for informations

## What is an IT Model
It is a plan and design created on a computer, used to make or improve a product or software. They often feature components such as the hardware, software, and the users using them.

## Types of Modelling
Often they are modelled in terms of:
- Function
- Architecture
- Analysis
- Design
- Data
- Context
- Behaviour

### Functional Modelling
It is a structed representation of a system, often created using techniques such as as a Functional Flow BLock Diagram, and IDEF), it is used to 
### Archtectural Modelling 
- Similar to functional modelling, but takes into consideration systems architecture.

### Analysis Modelling
Analyses what the user requirements is, depicting them in three separate domains,.
- Information Domain
- Functional Domain
- Behavioural Domain

Design modelling is also highly dependant on analysis modelling

### Design Modelling
This type of modelling provides different views and ideas of the system, wether through brainstorms, or methods such as data-driven, pattern-driven, or object oriented methods, for construction the design model.

### Data Modelling

### Context Modelling
This model is used to specify the boundaries ofa system, and represent the system as whole.
It gives a view on how the software works with the hardware.

### Behavioural Modelling
It represents how the system behaves,e and how it might be used to model the system data processing.

## Parts of a Computer
### Operating System
A collection of system sofware programs, that coordinates the interaction between hardware and software applictaions, as well as the interaction between a user nad the computer

### Motherboard
Main circuit board which connects, powers, and allows interaction for the gpu, cpu, ram, and drives. 

### CPU
The CPU (Central Processing Unit), often referred to as the brain of a computer, is responisble for controlling and computing in a computer.

The three major components of a CPU are:
- AU (Arithmetic Unit)
  Used to calculate and computate numbers
- CU (Control Unit)
  Used to give instructions to the AU, containing the instruction register, and programcounter.
- IDU (Instruction Decoding Unit)
  Used to decode the instruction

### RAM
The RAM (Random Access Memory) is used to store temporary data. It is often connected via SIMM or DIMM.
This is volatile memory, the data is wiped when unpowered.

### ROM
The ROM (Read Only Memory) is memory that cannot be overwritten, only read. Often used to store the BIOS of a system.
This is non-volatile memory, it retains data when power is shut off, by a CMOS Battery.

### BIOS
The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is used to store instructions that holds how to start a machine.

### Hard Drive
Two types, SSD and HDD

The HDD (Hard DIsk Drive) is a mechanical spinning disk drive, often used due to its price and storage capacity
The SSD (Solid State Drive) is a non mechanical drive, often used for its speed

### Input Devices
An input device is a hardware that is used by a user to input data into a system. They are used to issue instructions to a computer.
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Microphone

#### Device Drivers
This is a software used to translate the raw data from an input device such as a mouse, into a form that a computer can use and process.

### Output Devices
An output device is a hardware that is used to convert information coming from a computer, into a form that can be used by a user.
- VIsual
	- Monitors and Printers
- Auditory
	- Speakers
	- Headphones
- Tactile or Haptic
	- Haptic motors, vibrating
	- Braille output

### Serial and Parallel Ports
- Serial connectors are traditional ports, used for output devices.
	- VGA cable for connecting monitors
- Parallel connectors are traditional ports used for input devices.
	- Used for connecting a mouse

### USB Ports
Invented in the late 1990s, they USB (Universal Serial Bus) are connectors that has replaced serial and parallel connectors.
It is not an I/O device it self, but is instead used to connect either an input or output device to a computer.

#### Advantages of USB Ports
- One interface, for many devices
  Instead of having separate ports for input and output devices such as the serial and parellel port, a single USB port can be used for many peripherals
- Automatic Configuration
  When a USB peripheral is connected to a computer, the operating system automatically detects and loads the appropriate software driver used for the peripheral.
- Hot Pluggable
  You can connect and disconnect a peripheral whenever you want, without the need of restarting the computer.
- No power supply required for low voltage devices
  Due to the design of the USB, any peripheral that requires up to 500mA can be powered through the USB

### USB-A Generations
Gen 1 USB (USB1.0)
- First introduced in 1994

Gen 2 USB (USB2.0)
- Upgrade from USB1.0, in 2001
- USB 2.0 became popular due to its improvements over USB1.0
	- It is backwards compatible to USB1.0
	- Uses a new backwards compatible hub, which is 40x faster than USB1.0
		- Maximum speed of 480 Mbps

GEN 3 USB (USB3.0)
- Also known as "SuperSpeed USB"
- Upgrade from USB2.0
	- Boasts speeds of up to 10 times faster than USB 2.0
		- Maximum speed of 5Gbps

### USB-C
It is a 24pin USB connector, with a rotationally symmetrical design. This means it can be connected upside down.

It is the only connector to feature USB4, not to be confused with USB4.0
	- It features a maximujm speed of 40Gbps

### Power Supply
Used to convert AC voltage from the wall outlet to DC voltage which the computer can be used.

### DVD Drive
The DVD drive (Digital Versatile Disk) is a upgraded and alternative to the CD drive. It supports both CD's, and DVD's.
