**RESEARCH MORE ON MODELLING**


## Information Technlogy
- Information Technology is the storing, retreiving, and sending for informations

## What is an IT Model
It is a plan and design created on a computer, used to make or improve a product or software. They often feature components such as the hardware, software, and the users using them.

## Types of Modelling
Often they are modelled in terms of:
- Function
- Architecture
- Analysis
- Design
- Data
- Context
- Behaviour

### Functional Modelling
It is a structed representation of a system, often created using techniques such as as a Functional Flow BLock Diagram, and IDEF), it is used to 
### Archtectural Modelling 
- Similar to functional modelling, but takes into consideration systems architecture.

### Analysis Modelling
Analyses what the user requirements is, depicting them in three separate domains,.
- Information Domain
- Functional Domain
- Behavioural Domain

Design modelling is also highly dependant on analysis modelling

### Design Modelling
This type of modelling provides different views and ideas of the system, wether through brainstorms, or methods such as data-driven, pattern-driven, or object oriented methods, for construction the design model.

### Data Modelling

### Context Modelling
This model is used to specify the boundaries ofa system, and represent the system as whole.
It gives a view on how the software works with the hardware.

### Behavioural Modelling
It represents how the system behaves,e and how it might be used to model the system data processing.

## Parts of a Computer
### Operating System
A collection of system sofware programs, that coordinates the interaction between hardware and software applictaions, as well as the interaction between a user nad the computer

### Motherboard
Main circuit board which connects, powers, and allows interaction for the gpu, cpu, ram, and drives. 

### CPU
The CPU (Central Processing Unit), often referred to as the brain of a computer, is responisble for controlling and computing in a computer.

The three major components of a CPU are:
- AU (Arithmetic Unit)
  Used to calculate and com
