## String Literal
A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. For example, "hello".
Each string literal also ends with a [[Escape Sequence - C|escape character]] called the null character `\0`, which signals the end of a string. This is because a string in C, is essentially an array of characters.
`"hello" == ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0']`

**Non-Null Terminated String**
These are string literals which do not contain a null character `\0`.
