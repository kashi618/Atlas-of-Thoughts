## What is a  Process?
It is an application or program that is in execution. (It can also be known as the  execution of a sequence of instructions, whose net result is the provision of some system function or user function)
- A program becomes a process when it is loaded into memory

## Process States
When a process executes, it goes through various states.

**1) New**
The process is being created/started.

**2) Running**
Instructions are being executed/run on the CPU

**Waiting State**
The process is waiting for some event to occur, such as a keyboard input, hard disk access, etc.

**Ready State**
The process is waiting to be assigned to a CPU. It is essentially ready to be run

**Terminated State**
The process has finished execution.
