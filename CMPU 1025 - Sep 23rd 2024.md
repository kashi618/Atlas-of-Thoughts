## Data Types 2

| Type        | Size    | Range                  | Delimeter |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
| short       | 2 bytes | -32,000 > 32,000       | %sd       |
|             |         |                        |           |
| int         | 4 bytes | -2 billion > 2 billion | %d        |
| long        | 8 bytes | -Big Num > Big Num     | %ld       |
|             |         |                        |           |
| float       | 4 bytes | -2 billion > 2 billion | %f        |
| double      | 8 bytes | -Big Num > 2 Big Num   | %lf       |
|             |         |                        |           |
| char        | 1 byte  | n/a                    | %c        |
| boolean<br> | 1 byte  | True or False, 1 or 0  | %b        |
- All of these values are stored in RAM
- Float values are stored as normal values, but only with a decimal added

### Unsigned Variables
- Removes the negative range of a variable, and adding the extra memory to the positive side.
  Range of unsigned integer, range = 0 > 4 billion
``` cpp
unsigned int num1;
unsigned char char1;
unsigned bool bool1;
```

- For unsigned variables, add "u" before the delimeter
int = %uf, char = %uc, bool = %ub, etc

## Arithmetic Operations

| Operator | Meaning                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| +        | Addition                                    |
| -        | Subtraction                                 |
| *        | Multiplication                              |
| /        | Division                                    |
| %        | Modulus<br>This gives remainder of division |

## K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid)
- Make code easy, and simple to read, you idiot
- This makes troubleshooting and debugging far easier

## Escape Character
- Backslash "\\"

| Escape Sequence | Meaning               |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| \\n             | New line              |
| \\t             | Horizontal Indent/tab |
