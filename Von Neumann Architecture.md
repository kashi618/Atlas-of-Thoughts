### Defining Guidelines
- **Stored program concept** - program instructions and data the instructions operate on, are both stored in the same memory location (RAM)
- **Memory is addressed linearly** - memory addresses are stored in a straight continuous sequence. (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- **Memory addressed without regard to its content** - Both instructions and data are stored in ram
- **Instructions executed sequentially** - The CPU executes instructions one after another

### Main Components
**Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
Consists of 2 parts:
1. Control unit - fetches and executes instructions
2. Arithmetic logic unit - performs arithmetic (+, -, x, etc) and logical (OR, AND, etc) calculations

**Memory**
Stores data and instructions

**Input/Output Devices**
Allows the CPU to communicate with external hardware and devices

**Communication Bus**
Pathway that connects and allows data transfer from the CPU to memory and I/O
