**(Intro)**
This picture is about Japanese afterschool activities. The students are practising instruments in the classroom. There are many students, and it is a mixed school because there are male and female students.

**(Classroom | Bright, brown, windows)**
In the classroom, the walls and floor are brown. I think it looks nice, because in Irish schools the walls are white. The classroom is also very big and bright. I think this is because of the lights and the windows on the left side of the classroom. There are alot of windows, and they are very big. 

**(Female students | Marimba, uniform, summer uniform)**
Beside the window are 2 female students. The students are playing the marimba. The female students are wearing a black skirt and white t-shirt. They are wearing the japanese summer uniform. Japan has 2 uniforms because the winter is very cold and the summer is very hot. In Irish school, we only have 1 uniform. 

**(Male student | Uniform, mask, covid, drums, )**
Infront of the girl students is a male student playing the drums. The male student is wearing black pants and a mask. Perhaps he is wearing a mask because of corona. He is playing the drums. The drums are red and black. I like drums because I think they are cool. But my parents don't like the drums, because they are loud

**(Projector | French horn, tied hair, black bow, sitting, reading)**
At the top of the class room is a projector. Under the projector is a girl student playing the french horn. She is sitting down on the white chair, and reading the sheet music. Her hair is tied up, and she has a small black bow on her t-shirt.

**(Right Side | Flute players, pencil case, instrument bag)**
On the right side of the classroom, many of the students are playing the flute. They look very busy. On this female student's chair, is a red pencil case. Under the chair is a small black bag. Perhaps this is the instrument's bag.

**(Outro)**
I think Japanese club activities look fun, because you play instruments with your friends. In Japan, there are alot of club activities. For example band practise, baseball, kendou etc. In Irish schools, we only have sport club activities. For example, football, basketball, and volleyball.
