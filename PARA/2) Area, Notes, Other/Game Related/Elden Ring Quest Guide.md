It's generally a good idea to start by heading toward the map for each zone. (The exception to this is Mt Gelmir, where the map is pretty out of the way)
## Limgrave

- Talk to **White-Faced Varre** at the very start of the game, next to The First Step Grace.

- Enter Murkwater Cave near where you fought Nerijus. In the last room, open the chest and fight **Patches** until he surrenders. Then, stop and exhaust his dialogue. Reload the area and exhaust his dialogue. Then open the other chest nearby, which will transport you to Mistwood. Head North to the Third Church of Marika. Fast travel back to Murkwater Cave and talk to **Patches** again. Attack **Patches** until he starts fighting back. Avoid him until he gives you a gesture, then use that gesture. Then, reload the area and speak to Patches again.

(Note that he steals 30% of your runes every time you die, which you can only get back by killing him at the end of the castle. However, if you don’t kill him, he will sell a very valuable item at the end of **Nepheli’s** questline. So, the choice is yours.)

Note: You can complete this at any point during the game, and it will lock you into the frenzied flame ending.

- After defeating Melania, use the Unalloyed Gold Needle on the flower in the boss room to get Miquella’s needle
- Use Miquella’s needle in the boss arena of Dragonlord Placidusax’s in Crumbling Farum Azula. To find it, look for some debris you can jump onto between Dragon Temple Rooftop and Beside the Great Bridge (after the dragon, and before the elevator). Jump along the rubble until you find an empty grave that you can lay down in. You do not need to fight the boss.
