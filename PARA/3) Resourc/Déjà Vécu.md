> [!NOTE] Déjà Vécu
> A phenomenon that feels as if one has already lived through a whole sequence of events. Similar to [[Déjà Vu]], however it lacks the startling effect, and instantly dismissable quality. People experiencing [[Déjà Vécu]] often cannot tell if this intense feeling of familiarity is real or false, and may last for longer periods of time as opposed to [[Déjà Vu]].
