##### ▪️ Theme and Design
**What colours would be used:**
	Because this is a casual puzzle game, a neutral and simple colour palette was used. However, the tetronimos would change colour depending on the level. This would give a visual indicator of leveling up, whilst keeping the UI and interface neutral and simple.
