*In this world, beauty is called beauty because there is ugliness.*
*Good is called good because there is evil.*

*Thus, emptiness and existence transform into each other,*
*Difficult and easy come from each other.*
*Long and short compare to each other,*
*High and low flow from each other,*
*Sounds and voices blend together in harmony,*
*Before and after follow eachother.*

*Knowing this, the sage acts by doing nothing,*
*And reaches without saying a word.*
*The ten thousand things arise but he is silent.*
*Things grow but he takes nothing for himself.*

*He acts but doesn't compel.*
*He creates but seeks no recognition.*
*By not seeking recognition, he has nothing to lose.*

There are many pleasures and displeasures in this world, and they are like a cruel but balanced scale. If we wish for happiness, the there will surely be saddness. The more we aim for, and chase pleasure, the more uneven the scale for displeasure becomes. This also applies for good and evil. We only know of good actions, because we have experiences evil actions. Or how we only know beauty, because there is ugliness.

Instead of constantly chasing the left or right side of the scale, we should instead aim for balance, and inaction. This is not inaction as in being lazy. 

This is inaction as in we don't change or force things to become a certain way. Whether it be relationships, grades or jobs. Instead, we should observe, and take the opportunities already given to us. Instead of wanting to do the best on an assignment to become better than others, we should instead only do the best to what we can do.

When results appear, we do not take credit for it. It is not a case of being humble, or modest. After all, it wasn't due to our efforts that caused it to happen. We only allowed an opportunity to unfold, and let it flow naturally. By not forcing things to go a certain way, we achieve nonduality, and therefore have nothing to lose.
