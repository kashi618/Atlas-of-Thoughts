*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao*
Dao cannot be taught. If you are trying to teach the ways of Dao, then you are not actually teaching the true ways of the Dao. You can only find the true Dao, by yourself.

*The name that can be named is not the eternal name.*
The word Dao is only a placeholder, this name cannot, and does not, encapsulate the true way of the Dao.

*Nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth.*
It used to be nameless at the beginning of the world. Unnamed, not explained through words.

*Named, the mother of ten thousand things.*
Yet now it is named. We humans use the word Dao, giving it many meanings, hence, the "mother of ten thousand things". However, the Dao cannot be summed up with mere words.

*Being empty, see the wonder.*
When you don't have something, and wish for it, you are only wishing for the idea of having it.

*Being present, see the appearance.*
When you have it, you realise it is only what appears on the outside. The wonder is gone.

*These two are the same but have different names,*


*This is mystery.*

---
*Mystery upon mystery,*
*The doorway to wonder.*
