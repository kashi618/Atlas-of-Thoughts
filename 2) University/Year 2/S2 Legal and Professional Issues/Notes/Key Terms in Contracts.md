**Promissory Estoppel**
A shield that allows a promise to be enforced, even if it lacks the elements of a contract. It prevents a promisor from going back on their promise.

## Contract Terms

A minor term. If broken, you can still sue for damages. However, you still need to finish the contract

**Contra Proferentem**
A rue rule that if the term is value, the court interprets it against the person who wrote the contract

"Buyer beware". A seller doesn't have to point out every flaw in a product, unless you ask

A fundamental error in a contract, that goes to the very heart of the agreement, making it void or invalid

**Misrepresentation**
A false statement, that tricks someone into a contract. Can be innocent, negligent, or fraudulent
