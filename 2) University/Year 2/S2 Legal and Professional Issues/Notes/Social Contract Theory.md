## Core Belief
Without rules, nobody would create anything of value. Life would be in a state of nature "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, short". However, rational people understand that rules are necessary for meaningful cooperation to take place

These rules are called a social contract. It is an establishment of moral rules to govern relations among citizens

It is right for me to act according to a moral rule, if rational people would collectively accept it, because it benefits the community

## Rights
