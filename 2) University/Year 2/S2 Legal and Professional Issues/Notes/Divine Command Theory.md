## Case for DCT
- We owe obedience to God
- God is all-good and all-knowing
- God is the ultimate authority

## Case against DCT
- Holy books disagree with each other, even within the same religion. KJV vs NIV translations
- Many modern problems not addressed within scriptures. Is hacking theft? How about copyright?
- Society is multicultural, multi-faith, and also atheistic.

- If God is good, can things exist and be "good" without God, or is it only "good" because God says it is
  - "The Gods love piety because it is pious. It is not pious because they love it" - Plato
