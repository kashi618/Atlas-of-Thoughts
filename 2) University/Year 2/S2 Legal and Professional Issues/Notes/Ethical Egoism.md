## Core Belief
An action is morally right if and ONLY if it maximizes a persons own self interest

- "I ought to act in my own self-interest, but I make no claims about what others would do"

## Case for
- We are inclined to do whats best for ourselves
- Let other people take care of themselves, as we cannot know for sure what is good for them
- Dependence upon charity, leads to loss of self esteem

## Case against
- An easy moral philosophy, isn't necessarily the best moral philosophy
- Self interested focus can lead to blatantly immoral behaviour
- Does not recognise that to reap the benefits of living in community, individuals must consider the good of other community members.
