## What is Inheritance?
It is a core concept in OOP and Java that allows for code reuse. It allow allows for polymorphism, when a new class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.

## Key Terms
### Parent Class
Also known as the **superclass** or **base class**. It is a class the provides general attributes and methods for other classes to reuse/inherit from.

### Child Class
Also known as the **subclass** or **derived class**. It is a class that inherits properties from a parent/superclass.
*"It is like a parent class, but with a little bit more" - Colette*


## Notes
- Any attributes created in the child class, can only be used in the child class. It will not be present in the parent.

- Every user made class in Java, has a "**secret**" parent class that it takes methods and attributes from. For example, the `toString()` method. 
  It is called the object class or *"the Adam and Eve class" - Colette*
