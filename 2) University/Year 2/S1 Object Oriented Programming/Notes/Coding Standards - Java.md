## Naming Schemes

| Name           | Convention                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| class Names    | Starts uppercase. (`String, Colour, Thread`)                |
| interface name | Starts uppercase. Is adjective (`Runnable, ActionListener`) |
| method name    | Starts lowercase. Is verb. (`actionPerformed()`)            |
| variable name  | Starts lowercase. (`firstName, orderNumber`)                |
| package name   | Should be lowercase. (`java, lang, sql`)                    |
| constants name | should be fully uppercase. (`MAX_SIZE, RED`)                |

## Coding Principles/Standards
- Clarity over cleverness: use names that clearly express purpose, avoid vague and generic.
- **Be consistent**: follow the same naming patterns throughout codebase
- Reveal intent: good names explain WHY code exists, often removing need for comments
- **Keep it concise**: be descriptive but brief, avoiding long cluttered names and comments
- **Limit abbreviations**: use only well-known/common abbreviations
- **Get feedback**: ask for feedback
- **Avoid collisions**: don't reuse names with different meanings
