## What is it?
The process of sending digital/analogue data between a transmitter and a receiver.

Data is encoded onto a transmission signal, which is then transmitted across a medium called a transmission system

[[Data Encoding]] is changing the characteristic of a signal to, to represent the data. The more changes made to a signal, the more data can be transmitted.

## Transmission Signals
An electro-magnetic wave (EM), or an electric signal

**Electro-magnetic Waves**
- Radio waves
- Light waves
- Microwaves

**Electric Signals**
- Alternating Current AC
- Voltage pulses

## Transmission Systems
Some type of medium in which data transmission can occur.

### Types of Mediums
There are two main types:
- **Guided** (wired)
	- Twisted pair cables
	- Power lines
	- Fibre optic cables
- **Unguided** (wireless)
	- Radio waves
	- Infrared light waves
	- Electro-magnetic waves in space

## Transmission Mediums
It is the path along which a signal travels.
The type of medium determines the type of signal to be used, and can affect the reliability of communications

**Copper Wires**
Copper wires are usually used, due to its cheapness and low resistance to current
