## Example Data Rate Table
![[Data Rate Table.png]]
- At lower speeds, we get more harmonics. This means that the signal is more accurate/detailed. Readability increased.
- At the highest speed, the amount of harmonics reduces greatly. This reduces our ability to read the signal. Readability lessened.

## Harmonics Comparison
**1 Harmonic vs 2 Harmonics**
