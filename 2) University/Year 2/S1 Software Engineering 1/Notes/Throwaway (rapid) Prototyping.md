## What is it?
An approach to prototyping, where you build a fast and "cheap" version of of what is needed by the stakeholder. This is used to gather feedback from the stakeholders, clearing up any ambiguous requirements. It is then discarded, and the real product is built

This approach to prototyping relates more to its requirements, as its primary goal is to clarify what is not clear enough from the requirements, instead of focusing on trying to build the final product
