## Hardware for Systems
### Hardware Acquisition
When hardware is evaluated against the following factors
- Performance
	- Such as its speed, capacity, and throughput
- Cost
	- Such as the lease/purchase price, and the cost of operations and maintenance
- Reliability
	- Evaluating and identifying the risk of malfunction
	- Implementing error control and diagnostic features
- Compatability
	- Is it compatibal with existing  hardware and software?
	- Can the hardware and software be provided by alternative vendors?
- Future Proofing
	- What is the product life span?
	- Does it use new, unteested technology?
	- Does it run the risk of obsolescence
- Ergonomics
	- Is the equipment "human factor engineered"?
	- Is the hardware user friendly?
	- Is the hardware safe, comfortable, and easy to use?

## Software for Systems
### Software Acquisition
To get the most appropriate software for a particular tast, for the best possible price
- Getting the software may follow processes of planning, budgeting, requirements specificatyionm and negotiating contractz of procurement
- Then, the software development progress cn be monitored and evaluated

Software quisition considerations could be:
- PurposePlanning
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Quality
- Licensing
- Life span 
- Risks

### Types of Software
Generic (off the shelf) applications
- Well known packages used, such as word processors, accounting, image editors, etc 
- They are generic, as anyone is able to buy and use them

Bespoke Software
- Systems built specificly for individual people/organisations
	- They can also be customized generic software packages
- This type of software is often very costly, ans usually means it is not economically available

System Software
- This exists at the operating system layer. It included the operating system itself, compilers, editors, and any kind of software that supporyts the execution and/or development of applications

Application Software
- These are program used to complete specific tasks

Real-time Software
- This included programs that monitor/analyse/control real world events. E.g. A nuclear power plant cooling system


# Programming
The art of designing and giving instructions to ocmputers. It consists of several stage
- Analysis 
- Design 
- Coding
- Verification and testing
- Maintenance

## Coding
The actual process of writing the code. It consists of the processes of:
- Writing the code
- Compiling the code
- Testing the code 

 It can also be seen as interpreting the design deocuments into machine executable instructions

### Important Coding Tools
- A good editor 
- A good compiler 
- A good debugger

# Programming Languages
There are a variety of coding languages, with a variety of different factors used to choose a language to use, such as the:
- Platform (hardware, operating system, network)
- Programming Paradigm (Object Orientated/Function based, event based)
- The experience of the programmer with the langauge

There are also 2 types of langauges, procedural and OOPS

# Procedural Languages
Also known as an imperative languagem It is a type of programming langauge that specifies a series of well-structures steps. It contains a sysematic order of statements, functions,  and commands to create a program or solve a task

## Examples of Procedural Langauges
C
- Designed for efficiency
- Developed in 1969 at the Bell Telephone Laboratory by Dennis Richie
- Initiallty designed for the compilation of operating systems

# Object Oriented Languages - OOPS
Shortened for Object Oriented Programming System, it is a programming language system that focuses on creating code *objects* that developers can manipulate and impose rules on.
Object oriented programming makes it easier to reuse code, as the code written to do a certain task is independent from the rest of the program, allowing it to be easily extracted from one program to be used in another program.

For example, we can describe a car as an object
- The object car has attributes, such as the make, model, year of manufacture, etc
- It also has methods, such as the way you drive the car, and recording how far it has traveled

## Examples of Object Oriented Languages

C++  
• C had its features extended to include Object Orientated  
capabilities to become C++.  
• It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.  
• C ++ has heavily influenced the design of some newer languages  
such as C# and Java.  
• C++ is a complex language.

Python  
• Python coding was developed to follow up a programming language  
called ABC.  
• It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum and released around 1991.  
• Like other object oriented coding languages, Python is a scripting  
language, but is designed to require fewer lines of code for functions and  
concepts.  
• Python is now the world’s most popular software development language,  
it says on the Internet.

Java  
• Java coding was developed to support coding of software for  
‘cable’(or interactive) television.  
• It was developed by James Gosling and released around 1995.  
• Java was (and is) suitable for internet programming, which was  
taking off in the mid 1990s.  
• Java is a fairly complex language, as C++ might be said to be
