##### ▪️ Gameplay Overview
**What are the objectives:**
	The player controls a set of 5 different tetronimos falling from the top of the screen. Each tetronimo can also be rotated. The player has to place the tetronimos in such a way that it forms a complete line horizontally on the grid. By completing lines, it gets removed and the player scores a point. When the grid fills up, and no more tetronimos can be placed, the game will end.

##### ▪️ Theme and Design
**What colours would be used:**
	Because this is a casual puzzle game, a neutral and simple colour palette was used. However, the tetronimos would change colour depending on the level. This would give a visual indicator of leveling up, whilst keeping the UI and interface neutral and simple.
