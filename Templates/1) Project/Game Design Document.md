### **Concept** 💡
##### ▪️ Gameplay Overvie
   The player controls a set of 5 different tetronimos falling from the top of the screen. Each tetronimo can also be rotated. The player has to place the tetronimos in such a way that it forms a complete line horizontally on the grid. By completing lines, it gets removed and the player scores a point. When the grid fills up, and no more tetronimos can be placed, the game will end.

### **Art** 🎨

##### ▪️ Theme / Colour Palette
   Because this is a casual puzzle game, a neutral and simple colour palette was used. However, the tetronimos would change colour depending on the level. This would give a visual indicator of leveling up, whilst keeping the UI and interface neutral and simple.
