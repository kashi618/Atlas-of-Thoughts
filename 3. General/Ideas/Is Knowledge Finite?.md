## Chapter 1
This question sparked from a philosophical argument I had with my older brother during work.

We began talking about the future. A Utopian world in which medical science reached to a point of immortal, everlasting humans/beings.

Past humans survived and lived their lives through hunting. It was both a form of entertainment, and a way to feed their families. It kept them fit, full, but most importanly sane.
In this hypothetical Utopian universe, utopian is mean't in a way where humans have every physical need satisfied. Unlimited food, water, and entertainment. Humans are satisfied in every way physically. 

{why is possile?}

I posed the question of boredom. Due to a world in which there is nothing else left to do, life seems almost meaningless.

An example can be seen from the movie "In Time". In this world, it shows a dystopian future in which time is used as a literal currency. Time as in how much longer you have, until you cease. The rich hoarded their time currency, many accumulating so much, it results in basically immortality. Meanwhile, the rest of the world works day by day, living "time to time", making barely enouhg time to live. The rich lived in specific distinct "sectors", segregating the rich and the poor.
Early on in the movie we see one of the "immortal" rich people travel to the poorest sector. He has lived so long, that living more is meaningless. Ultimately it ends up in him killing himself, and giving the remaining (near infinite) time currency to our protagonist.
Why did the rich give away his time for death? he was able to live very lavishly, forever, yet gave away his life due to boredom. This makes immortality seem meek, dark, and depressing. A world in which I believed would not be pleasurable.

Yet, my older brother posed a simple answer. If in Utopian world, where everything a human physically needs to survive is satiated, the only thing left is to satiate the mind. By satiating the mind, this would mean to accumulate knowledge. Looking only at the meaningless side of everlasting life, would be looking only at half the equation. What if, through time, we instead become more and more "inteligent", almost to a point where millions upon millions (infinity) are spent upon accumulating knowledge?

To kill oneself such as the catalyst from themovie, would mean there was no reason to live. A life where boredom overcomes you to the point of death. However, knowledge would be a very unique solution. Where the Utopian society satiates the body, knowledge would satiate the mind.

## Chapter 2
Now that we found a "reason" for immortality, it poses much more questions.

If we had an infinite lifespan, would we every run out of new things to "learn"?

```

It started from talking about a point in the future, where medical skills have improved so much so, that humans are essentially able to live forever. To become immortal and everlasting in a way. By allowing humans



spend time chasing mind and soul instead of physicality

chasing mind makes you smart

if everyone was immortal, and was all able to become well read and "all knowing", would we not become the same people
Knowledge is only useful if every one knows it. such as physics, newton and einstein

Knowledge to my current understanding is infinite. Non limited. Limitless

Why? mathematically limitless concepts are possible, and is used in our everydya lives. The concept of infinity, of irrational numbers sqrt(2) and pi.

Limitless i possible, but is our brain possible to be limitles?

Physicaly our Brain has a limit. Would our brains grow larger and larger? 

If knowledge is limitless, would this disreguard the evidence of an omni-present all-knowing God?

If we humans, are given an infinite lifespan, what stops us from becoming God itself, if not for the fact the knowledge is limited or limitless
