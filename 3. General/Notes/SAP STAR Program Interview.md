# Presentation
## Things to look up
- SAP S/4HANA
- Alex

## Proposition (My argument)
- One source of truth
- Proactive (learns)
- Language/translation

## Funnies
- I read in the emails, that "Alex" was used to schedule this interview. Just as Alex streamlined my interview, SAP's AI 1st approach can streamline a patient's journey from GP to a doctor or specialized consultant

### Issues (Problems which can be solved)
**Fragmented**
- Patient data "silo-ed" across many hospitals and GP's
  - Need to explain situation to every hospital and GP

## Opposition (What I will be asked)
- AI risks
- Data privacy risks
- Why SAP?
- Server crash/downtime?
  - WannaCry 2.0? (2017)

# Script
## Slide 1 - Introduction & Reason for Hospitality
{**Introduction**}
Hi I'm Neil Jiang, and I am a student at TUD studying computer science.

{**Reason for Choice**}
For this presentation, I'm focusing on the irish public healthcare system.

This is because I have first-hand experience navigating its complexities, as I often accompany my mother to her consultations and appointments, acting as a translator due to her poor English.

Through these trips, my mother and I have been encountered many points of friction and inefficiencies within the system, which I believe that SAP will be able to solve.

## Slide 2 - Outline Issues met
{**Outline Issues Met**}
From my experience going through the process of the initial consultation with the GP, the referral process, or speaking to specialists, three main issues and problems have become evident.

{**Fragmented patient information across systems**}
The first issue is patient data silo's. 
Patient medical histories are fragmented. In my experience, every GP and Hospital has their own database for storing a patients information. Records don't travel with the patient. This requires them to repeat their condition multiple times to every GP, hospital, and specialist consultant during their journey. Although referral letters may contain some information, it is often not the full picture.

{**Language barrier**}
The second issue is language barriers.
According to the 2022 census in Ireland, over 2% of the population in speaks poor English. Seemingly small, it translates to over 100k people in Ireland.

{**Scheduling hours are a pain**}
The last issue I have encountered, is that GP's often have very restrictive opening hours. Some open only 6 hours a day, during weekdays. If you have an emergency on the weekend, you are often left waiting until Monday morning just to book an appointment for a alter date.

{**Outro**}
Well, how do we fix t Lets start with SAP's "suite first" approach

## Slide 3 - "Suite 1st" Solution
{**Suite 1st**}
Essentially, we create a unified source for a patients medical history, by using SAP's S4/HANNA Cloud database. By unifying a patients medical history we create a system where GP's, hospitals, and specialist consultants are able to work together instead of apart, creating a "single source of truth".

This means interoperability, where when a GP enters data, it is instantly accessible securely through SAP's cloud database by a Hospital, and vice verse.


## Slide 4 - "AI 1st" Solution
Once the suite/database is in place, we can then use the AI first strategy to build our core system.

{**AI for scheduling**}
- Just like how Alex scheduled this interview today, we can use SAP's Joule to manage patient bookings. This means that patients can book appointments 24/7 seamlessly online.
- There have been times where I urgently needed to schedule an appointment at the GP, but it was the weekend, forcing me to wait until Monday. SAP Joule will eliminate that.

{**AI for language**}
- Second, SAP's generative AI can also offer real-time, medical-grade translations for patients like my mother. This allows doctors to focus on treating patients, instead of communication. This is helpful for patients who either cannot afford, or wait for an available interpreter, especially if they speak a rare language.
- Even for Mandarin Chinese, the language my mother and I speak, it is very hard to find skilled and qualified interpreter.

## Slide 5 - Year 1-3 Migrating from Legacy to SAP
Year 1 will focus

Year 2 will focus on migrating the data from the hospitals and GP into SAP's HANA Cloud network. 

Year 3 will focus on using SAP's Business Technology Platform to connect GP's and hospitals, allowing for a seamless integration of managing patient data between GP's and hospitals.

## Slide 6 - Year 4-5 "AI first"
Years 4-5 will focus by changing from a reactive, to proactive AI based healthcare system.
Just like Alex, AI scheduling methods will be implemented, allowing patients to register and book appointments 24/7.

## Slide 7 - Issues Which May Occur During Deployment
{**AI Unpredictability during translation**}
AI might mess up translations, causing major issues.
How To fix:
- idk

{**Possible data breach, or virus?**}
S4/HANA Cloud succeptible to online attacks by bad actors. An example of this is the WANACRY pandemic in 2017. This was a computer virus that essentially shut down windows computers due to a bug. Causes millions of computers to break, including life saving medical equipment
How To Fix:
- S/4HANA Cloud is securely managed centrally by SAP. It provides enterprise-grade encryption, instead of relying on a local GP/hospital.

{**Job Security for administrative/secretary work**}
My GF works as an admin at a hospital. When I was preparing for this presentation, she was worried about her job being replaced by AI.
But I believe that this will never be the case. Although Joule will speed up scheduling, there should still be human admins for elderly, or those which are unable to use the software. or if any bugs appear
How To Fix:
AI will handles monotonous and repetitive tasks such as scheduling and data entry. This allows human admins to focus on higher value tasks, such as support for elderly patients who aren't tech-savvy, complex emergency cases, and for providing empathy which an AI cannot replicate

{**GDPR Patient Privacy Act **}

{**Outro**}
In the next five years, SAP's Suite 1st and AI 1st approach isn't just about upgrading software. Instead, it is about moving away from fragmented systems. We ensuring that people who are in need of medical care, will not be stopped either by scheduling or language barriers, because the system already understands, supports, and prioritizes their care.

Thank you for listening, and I hope you found it interesting
