# Presentation
## Things to look up
- SAP S/4HANA
- Alex

## Proposition (My argument)
- One source of truth
- Proactive (learns)
- Language/translation

## Funnies
- I read in the emails, that "Alex" was used to schedule this interview. Just as Alex streamlined my interview, SAP's AI 1st approch can streamline a patient's journey from GP to a doctor or specialized consultant

### Issues (Problems which can be solved)
**Fragmented**
- Patient data "silo-ed" across many hospitals and GP's
  - Need to explain situation to every hospital and GP

## Opposition (What I will be asked)
- AI risks
- Data privacy risks
- Why SAP?
- Server crash/downtime?
  - WannaCry 2.0? (2017)

# Script
## Slide 1 - Introduction & Reason for Hospitality
{**Introduction**}
Hi I'm Neil Jiang. I am a student at TUD studying computer science.

{**Reason for Choice**}
For this presentation, I chose to focus on the industry of the public healthcare system in Ireland.

This is because I have first-hand experience navigating the system, as I often accompany my mother to her consultations and appointments, acting as a translator due to her poor English.

And through these trips, me and my mother have been met with many points of friction and inefficiencies in the system. 

## Slide 2 - Outline Issues met
{**Outline Issues Met**}
From my experience going through the process of the initial consultation with the GP, the referral process, or speaking to specialists, three main issues and problems have become evident.

{**Fragmented patient information across systems**}
The first issue is patient data silo's. This basically means that each hospital and GP, has their own 
A patient's history doesn't travel with them.

{**Language barrier**}
According to the 2022 census, over 2% of the population in Ireland spoke poor English. This is not counting those who speak irish.
It seems small, but that is over 20,000 per 1 million. Around 100k in Ireland.

{**Scheduling hours are a pain**}
The last issue I have encountered, is that GP's often have very strict opening hours.
The local GP near me, opens Mon-Fri, (8:30-11:30, 3:30-5:30) 5 hours total.

## Slide 3 - "Suite 1st" Solution
{**Define Suite 1st**}

{**Suite 1st for connected care**}
Doctors, nurses, specialized consultants won't need to be brought up to speed by the patient. Everything is stored in a database that follows a computer sciency term called a "single source of truth"
This means that the GP's and Hospitals work togthor, building up the patients history and data.



## Slide 4 - "AI 1st" Solution
{AI for schechuling}
- Seamless scheduling, as present from Alex.

{AI for language}
GP nurse and doctor focuses purely on helping the patient


## Slide 5 - Year 1-3 Implementation

## Slide 6 - Year 4-5 Deployment

## Slide 7 - Common Issues
{**Loss of admin jobs?**}

{**Possible data breach, or virus?**}


{**Conclusion**}
That is the end
I hope you found it interesting, and that you would relate to this
Thank you
