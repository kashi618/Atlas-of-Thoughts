# Presentation
## Things to look up
- SAP S/4HANA
- Alex

## Proposition (My argument)
- One source of truth
- Proactive (learns)
- Language/translation

## Funnies
- I read in the emails, that "Alex" was used to schedule this interview. Just as Alex streamlined my interview, SAP's AI 1st approch can streamline a patient's journey from GP to a doctor or specialized consultant

### Issues (Problems which can be solved)
**Fragmented**
- Patient data "silo-ed" across many hospitals and GP's
  - Need to explain situation to every hospital and GP

## Opposition (What I will be asked)
- AI risks
- Data privacy risks
- Why SAP?
- Server crash/downtime?
  - WannaCry 2.0? (2017)
