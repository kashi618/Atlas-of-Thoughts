# Presentation
## Things to look up
- SAP S/4HANA
- Alex

## Proposition (My argument)
- One source of truth
- Proactive (learns)
- Language/translation

## Funnies
- I read in the emails, that "Alex" was used to schedule this interview. Just as Alex streamlined my interview, SAP's AI 1st approch can streamline a patient's journey from GP to a doctor or specialized consultant

### Issues (Problems which can be solved)
**Fragmented**
- Patient data "silo-ed" across many hospitals and GP's
  - Need to explain situation to every hospital and GP

## Opposition (What I will be asked)
- AI risks
- Data privacy risks
- Why SAP?
- Server crash/downtime?
  - WannaCry 2.0? (2017)

# Script
## Slide 1 - Introduction & Reason for Hospitality
{**Introduction**}
Hi I'm Neil Jiang. I am a student at TUD studying computer science.

{**Reason for Choice**}
For this presentation, I chose to focus on the industry of the public healthcare system in Ireland.

This is because I have first-hand experience navigating the system, as I often accompany my mother to her consultations and appointments, acting as a translator due to her poor English.

And through these trips, me and my mother have been met with many points of friction and inefficiencies within the system. 

## Slide 2 - Outline Issues met
{**Outline Issues Met**}
From my experience going through the process of the initial consultation with the GP, the referral process, or speaking to specialists, three main issues and problems have become evident.

{**Fragmented patient information across systems**}
The first issue is patient data silo's. 
A patients medical history is fragmented, as each GP and Hospital has their own database for storing the information. Hospitals often don't share this, leading to patients needing to repeat their condition multiple times to various people. A patient's history doesn't travel with them.

{**Language barrier**}
The second issue is language barriers. According to the 2022 census, over 2% of the population in Ireland speaks poor English.
It seems small, but that is over 20,000 per 1 million. Around 100k in Ireland.

{**Scheduling hours are a pain**}
The last issue I have encountered, is that GP's often have very strict opening hours.
The local GP near me, opens Mon-Fri, (8:30-11:30, 3:30-5:30) 5 hours total.

{**Outro**}
How do we fix this? Lets start with SAP's "suite first" approach

## Slide 3 - "Suite 1st" Solution
{**Suite 1st**}
Essentially, we create a unified source for a patients medical history, by using SAP's S4/HANNA Cloud database. By unifying a patients medical history we create a system where GP's, hospitals, and specialist consultants are able to work together instead of apart, creating a "single source of truth".

This means interoperability, where when a GP enters data, it is instantly accessible securely through SAP's cloud database by a Hospital, and vice verse.


## Slide 4 - "AI 1st" Solution
Once the suite/database is in place, we can then use the AI first strategy to build our core system.

{**AI for scheduling**}
- Just like how Alex scheduled this interview today, we can use SAP's Joule to manage patient bookings. This means that patients can book appointments 24/7 seamlessly online.
- There have been times where I urgently needed to schedule an appointment at the GP, but it was the weekend, forcing me to wait until Monday. SAP Joule will eliminate that.

{**AI for language**}
- Second, SAP's generative AI can also offer real-time, medical-grade translations for patients like my mother. This allows doctors to focus on treating patients, instead of communication. This is helpful for patients who either cannot afford, or wait for an available interpreter, especially if they speak a rare language.
- Even for Mandarin Chinese, it is very hard to find skilled and available interpreters

## Slide 5 - Year 1-3 Implementation
{**Focusing moving from fragmented legacy systems, to a unified system**}


## Slide 6 - Year 4-5 Deployment


## Slide 7 - Issues Which May Occur During Deployment
{**AI Unpredictability?**}
Due to the unpredictability of AI, we have to remember that generative AI is first and for most a too.

{**Possible data breach, or virus?**}
The suite first approach means that all patient data are stored on the cloud. This is succeptible to online attacks by bad actors.
A good example of this is the wannacry pandemic in 2017. This was a computer virus that essentialy shut down many windows computers, including hospital systems. You can imagine the damage this caused, as 


{**Job Security?**}
My GF works as an admin at a hospital, when I was preparing for this presentation, she was worried about her job being replaced by AI.



{**Conclusion**}
That is the end
I hope you found it interesting, and that you would relate to this
Thank you
