## 德经
#### 1
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
Nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth.
Named, the mother of ten thousand things.

Being empty, see the wonder.
Being present, see the appearance.
These two are the same but have different names,
This is mystery.

Mystery upon mystery,
The doorway to wonder.
#### 2
In this world, beauty is called beauty because there is ugliness.
Good is called good because there is evil.

Thus, emptiness and existence transform into each other,
Difficult and easy come from each other.
Long and short compare to each other,
High and low flow from each other,
Sounds and voices blend together in harmony,
Before and after follow eachother.

Knowing this, the sage acts by doing nothing,
And reaches without saying a word.
The ten thousand things arise but he is silent.
Things grow but he takes nothing for himself.

He acts but doesn't compel.
He creates but seeks no recognition.
By not seeking recognition, he has nothing to lose.
#### 3
Don't honor good men, and the people will not strive.
Don't value rare goods, and the people will not steal.
Don'ty show off valuables, and the peoples' hearts will not be confused.

Thus, the wise ruler empties minds and fills stomachs,
Weakens ambitions and strengthens bones.

Make sure the people have no knowledge and no desire.
Those who have knowledge will not dare to act!

Do without doing, and all will be peaceful.
#### 4
Dao is a bottomless cup that need not be filled.
Profound and deep, it is the root of ten thousand things.

It blunts sharpness, looseens tangles,
Soften brightnessm makes us as dust.

Deep and profound! It barely exists.

I don;t know whose child it is.
It appeared before the great kings.
#### 5
Heaven and earth aren't kind;
To them, the ten thousand things are as straw dogs.

The sage isn't kind;
To him, the common people are as straw dogs.

Isn't the space between heaven and earth like a bellows?
It is empty but cannot be exhausted
The more it moves, the more comes out.
The more you talk, the weaker you become.

Better to remain centered.
#### 6
The spirit of the center is called the mysterious feminine.
Its doorway is called the source of heaven and earth.

It seems to be unbroken.
Use it; it never ends.
#### 7
Heaven is eternal, earth lasts a long time,
So heaven and earth can last forver.
They don't live for themselves,
So they can live a long time.

Thus, the sage puts himself behind,
Yet finds himself in front.
Giving no thought for himself,
He survives.

Is it because he is selfless
That he can achieve selfish goals?
#### 8
The highest kindness is like water.
Water's kindess benefits everything, yet it doesn't strive,
It even lives in places that everyone dislikes, like the Dao.

The virtue of a home is its land,
The vitrtue of the heart is its depth,
The vitrtue of a friendship is its kindness,
The vitrtue of speech is its honesty,
The vitrtue of governing is establishing peaceful order,
The vitrtue of doing your duty is being competent,
The vitrtue of action is its timing.

When there is no striving, there is no blame.
#### 9
Filling up isn't as good as knowing when to stop.
A sharp point can't be maintained for long.

When gold and jade fill a room, no one can protect it.
When wealth leads to arrogance, it invites mistakes.

Achieve success, then let it go.
This is the Dao of heaven.

#### 10
The body embraces the soul,
Can you not split them apart?

Concentrate the breath to become soft,
Can you be like a newborn infant?

Purify and examine your deepest thoughts,
Can you be without blemish?

Love  the citizens andgovern the nation,
Can you do nothing?

Open your senses to meet the world,
Can you remain calm?

See clearly in all four directions,
Can you not interfere?

Create and nurture,
Create but don't possess,
Act but don't compel,
Lead but don't dominate.

This is called the primal De
