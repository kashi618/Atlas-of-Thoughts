*Wouldn't doctors earn the same amount as a janitor then?*
In a pure communist society, there would be no money or things to "earn". Communism was idealized because the rich got richer, and the poorer got poorer. For example, Tsar Nicholas was one of the richest man in the world. He was rich only due to owning all the land in Russia, and forcing the peasants to pay him. There is a big difference in the amount of work he put in to get his wealth, as compared to the peasants who are worked to death.
So although doctors won't be payed more, they would get more benefits due to the work they are putting in. Such as qol improvents, bigger homes, better foods, more luxury items, etc.

### Questions
- Would doctors earn the same amount as peasants?
	In a pure communist society, then yes. However, communism isn't about money. The reason why communism was made, was because that the bourgosie did few to no work for the amount of money they were getting. Tsar Nicholas was one of the richest man in the world, yet all he did was attend meetings and fuck around. He was rich, because he owned all the land in Russia, and was able to make the workers pay him for the land. Communism aim's to solve this work inequality, and only rewards those who put it in the effort to work.
