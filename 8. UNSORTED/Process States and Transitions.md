## Process States
When a process executes, it goes through various states.

**New State**
The process is being created/started.

**Running State**
Instructions are being executed/run on the CPU

**Waiting State**
The process is waiting for some event to occur, such as a keyboard input, hard disk access, etc.

**Ready State**
The process is waiting to be assigned to a CPU. It is essentially ready to be run

**Terminated State**
The process has finished execution.

## Process State Transitions
**Interrupt Transition**
This can be generated by two things
- External application/hardware event
- Time slice assigned by scheduler expires

**I/O or Wait Transition**
This arises when a process needs to pause to gather extra data.
- The CPU is freed during this transition, as it may take time to gather the data.

**Scheduler Dispatch Transition**
This transition means that the process can be run on the CPU, based on the OS schedule scheme.
